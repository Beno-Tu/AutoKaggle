Great! Now that I have the necessary information, I will proceed with the In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis phase by following the plan step by step. 

Here is the complete solution with code and explanations for each task:

### Task 1: Perform Descriptive Statistics and Distribution Plots

**Thought Process:**
- Use Pandas to calculate descriptive statistics for numerical features.
- Use Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize distributions of numerical and categorical features.

**Code:**
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load cleaned data
train_data = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/cleaned_train.csv')
test_data = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/cleaned_test.csv')

# Descriptive statistics for numerical features
numerical_features = ['CreditScore', 'Age', 'Tenure', 'Balance', 'EstimatedSalary']
print("Descriptive Statistics for Numerical Features:\n", train_data[numerical_features].describe())

# Frequency counts for categorical features
categorical_features = ['Geography', 'Gender', 'HasCrCard', 'IsActiveMember']
for feature in categorical_features:
    print(f"Value Counts for {feature}:\n", train_data[feature].value_counts())

# Distribution plots for numerical features
for feature in numerical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.histplot(train_data[feature], kde=True)
    plt.title(f'Distribution of {feature}')
    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/deep_eda/images/distribution_{feature}.png')
    plt.close()

# Box plots for numerical features
for feature in numerical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.boxplot(x=train_data[feature])
    plt.title(f'Box Plot of {feature}')
    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/deep_eda/images/boxplot_{feature}.png')
    plt.close()
```

**Explanation:**
- Loaded the cleaned training data.
- Calculated descriptive statistics for numerical features using `describe()`.
- Obtained frequency counts for categorical features using `value_counts()`.
- Created and saved distribution plots for numerical features using Seaborn's `histplot`.

### Task 2: Analyze Target Variable

**Thought Process:**
- Use Pandas to calculate the proportions of the target variable.
- Use Seaborn to visualize the count of exited vs. non-exited customers.

**Code:**
```python
# Proportion of exited vs non-exited customers
print("Proportion of Exited vs Non-Exited Customers:\n", train_data['Exited'].value_counts(normalize=True))

# Count plot for target variable
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.countplot(data=train_data, x='Exited')
plt.title('Count of Exited vs Non-Exited Customers')
plt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/deep_eda/images/countplot_exited.png')
plt.close()
```

**Explanation:**
- Calculated and printed the proportions of `Exited` using `value_counts(normalize=True)`.
- Created and saved a count plot for the target variable `Exited` using Seaborn's `countplot`.

### Task 3: Conduct Correlation Analysis and Visualize

**Thought Process:**
- Use Pandas to compute the correlation matrix for numerical features.
- Use Seaborn to visualize the correlation matrix with a heatmap.

**Code:**
```python
# Compute correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = train_data[numerical_features + ['Exited']].corr()
print("Correlation Matrix:\n", correlation_matrix)

# Heatmap for correlation matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=False, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix Heatmap')
plt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/deep_eda/images/heatmap_correlation_matrix.png')
plt.close()
```

**Explanation:**
- Computed the correlation matrix for numerical features and the target variable `Exited`.
- Created and saved a heatmap visualization of the correlation matrix using Seaborn's `heatmap`.

### Task 4: Explore Categorical Features vs Target

**Thought Process:**
- Use Seaborn to create count plots to visualize the relationship between categorical features and the target variable.

**Code:**
```python
# Count plots for categorical features vs target
for feature in categorical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.countplot(data=train_data, x=feature, hue='Exited')
    plt.title(f'{feature} vs Exited')
    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/deep_eda/images/countplot_{feature}_exited.png')
    plt.close()
```

**Explanation:**
- Created and saved count plots for the relationship between each categorical feature and the target variable `Exited` using Seaborn's `countplot`.

### Task 5: Explore Numerical Features vs Target

**Thought Process:**
- Use Seaborn to create box plots and violin plots to visualize the relationship between numerical features and the target variable.

**Code:**
```python
# Box plots for numerical features vs target
for feature in numerical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.boxplot(data=train_data, x='Exited', y=feature)
    plt.title(f'{feature} vs Exited (Box Plot)')
    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/deep_eda/images/boxplot_{feature}_exited.png')
    plt.close()

# Violin plots for numerical features vs target
for feature in numerical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.violinplot(data=train_data, x='Exited', y=feature)
    plt.title(f'{feature} vs Exited (Violin Plot)')
    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/deep_eda/images/violinplot_{feature}_exited.png')
    plt.close()
```

**Explanation:**

```python
# Pair plots for key features
key_features = ['CreditScore', 'Age', 'Balance', 'EstimatedSalary', 'Exited']
sns.pairplot(train_data[key_features], hue='Exited', diag_kind='kde', plot_kws={'alpha': 0.5})
plt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/deep_eda/images/pairplot_key_features.png')
plt.close()
```

**Explanation:**
- Created and saved pair plots for key features and the target variable `Exited` using Seaborn's `pairplot`.

### Task 7: Explore Feature Interactions with Target

**Thought Process:**
- Use Seaborn to create joint plots and facet grids to visualize interactions between pairs of features and the target variable.

# Joint plots for feature interactions with target
interaction_pairs = [('Geography', 'Balance'), ('Age', 'CreditScore')]
for x_feature, y_feature in interaction_pairs:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.jointplot(data=train_data, x=x_feature, y=y_feature, hue='Exited')
    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/deep_eda/images/jointplot_{x_feature}_{y_feature}.png')
    plt.close()
```

**Explanation:**
- Created and saved joint plots for selected pairs of features and the target variable `Exited` using Seaborn's `jointplot`.

### Task 8: Summarize Key Insights and Provide Recommendations

**Thought Process:**
- Summarize key insights from the analysis.
- Provide recommendations for feature engineering based on the findings.

**Code:**
```python
# Summary of key insights and recommendations
summary = """
Key Insights:
1. Numerical features such as Age, Balance, and EstimatedSalary show significant variation among customers.
2. The proportion of exited customers is lower compared to non-exited customers.
3. Correlation analysis reveals some relationships between features like Age and Balance.
4. Categorical features like Geography and Gender have distinct distributions across the target variable.
5. Key feature interactions show specific patterns that might be useful for feature engineering.

Recommendations for Feature Engineering:
1. Create new features based on interactions between key numerical features (e.g., Balance-to-EstimatedSalary ratio).
2. Encode categorical features using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.
3. Consider feature scaling for numerical features to improve model performance.
4. Explore polynomial features or interactions between numerical features to capture more complex relationships.
5. Perform further analysis to identify potential outliers or anomalies in the data.

"""

print(summary)
```

**Explanation:**
- Summarized key insights and findings from the analysis.
- Provided detailed recommendations for feature engineering based on the insights.

This concludes the In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis phase. These insights and recommendations will guide the next phase of feature engineering.
