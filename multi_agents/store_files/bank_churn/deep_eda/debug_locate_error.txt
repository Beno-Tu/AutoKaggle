Given that no pre-defined tools were used in this phase, we can focus directly on the code causing the error. The error message indicates that the `sns.jointplot` function is being used incorrectly with a categorical variable. Specifically, `Geography` is a categorical variable and is not suitable for `jointplot`, which requires numeric or datetime variables.

The most relevant code snippet causing the error is:

```python
interaction_pairs = [('Geography', 'Balance'), ('Age', 'CreditScore')]
for x_feature, y_feature in interaction_pairs:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.jointplot(data=train_data, x=x_feature, y=y_feature, hue='Exited')
    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/deep_eda/images/jointplot_{x_feature}_{y_feature}.png')
    plt.close()
```

In this snippet, the pair `('Geography', 'Balance')` is problematic because `Geography` is a categorical variable. This mismatch is what leads to the `TypeError`.
