Data Loading:\n   - Always load data files from the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/` directory.\n   - Use specific files for each phase:\n     - Data Cleaning: `train.csv` and `test.csv`\n     - Feature Engineering: `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`\n     - Model Building, Validation, and Prediction: `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`\n\n2. Data Saving:\n   - Save image files in the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/deep_eda/images/` directory.\n   - Save data files in the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/` directory.\n   - Use clear, meaningful names for image files that reflect their content.\n   - Do NOT use special characters like `/` or spaces in file names.\n   - Save specific files for each phase:\n     - Data Cleaning: `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`\n     - Feature Engineering: `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`\n\n3. Data Processing:\n   - Always work on a copy of the DataFrame, not the original.\n   - Ensure correct data types for all columns before any operations.\n   - Apply consistent modifications (e.g., scaling, encoding) to both training and test sets.\n   - Take care with target-dependent operations on the test set, which lacks the target variable.\n   - Do NOT modify Id-type columns.\n\n## CODING PRACTICES ##\n1. General Rules:\n   - Use `print()` for outputting values.\n   - Avoid writing `assert` statements.\n\n2. Visualization:\n   - Use `plt.close()` after saving each image.\n   - Limit EDA visualizations to 10 or fewer, focusing on the most insightful.\n   - Optimize for large datasets (e.g., `annot=False` in seaborn heatmaps).\n\n3. Efficiency:\n   - Prioritize runtime efficiency, especially for:\n     - Data visualization\n     - Large dataset handling\n     - Complex algorithms\n\n## EXAMPLES ##\n- Before calculating a correlation matrix, ensure all data is numerical. Handle non-numerical data appropriately.\n- Verify consistent data types across columns before merging or joining operations.\n\nRemember: Always consider resource constraints and prioritize efficiency in your code.\n"

Correlation analysis reveals some relationships between features like Age and Balance.\n4. Categorical features like Geography and Gender have distinct distributions across the target variable.\n5. Key feature interactions show specific patterns that might be useful for feature engineering.\n\nRecommendations for Feature Engineering:\n1. Create new features based on interactions between key numerical features (e.g., Balance-to-EstimatedSalary ratio).\n2. Encode categorical features using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.\n3. Consider feature scaling for numerical features to improve model performance.\n4. Explore polynomial features or interactions between numerical features to capture more complex relationships.\n5. Perform further analysis to identify potential outliers or anomalies in the data.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(summary)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- Summarized key insights and findings from the analysis.\n- Provided detailed recommendations for feature engineering based on the insights.\n\nThis concludes the In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis phase.
