To select the most relevant images for the "In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis" phase, I will focus on images that provide insights into the distribution of features, relationships between variables, and correlations. Hereâ€™s the selection:

1. **Boxplots** for individual features segmented by the target variable (exited).
2. **Count plots** to understand categorical variables related to churn.
3. **Distributions** for numerical features to identify patterns.
4. **Heatmap** for correlation analysis.
5. **Joint plots** and **pair plots** to visualize relationships between key features.

Based on this rationale, here are the chosen images:

```json
{
    "images": [
        "boxplot_Age_exited.png",
        "boxplot_Balance_exited.png",
        "boxplot_CreditScore_exited.png",
        "boxplot_EstimatedSalary_exited.png",
        "countplot_exited.png",
        "countplot_Gender_exited.png",
        "heatmap_correlation_matrix.png",
        "pairplot_key_features.png"
    ]
}
```
