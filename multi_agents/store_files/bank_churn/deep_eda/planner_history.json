Understand Background\n2. Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis\n3. Data Cleaning\n4. In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis\n5. Feature Engineering\n6. Model Building, Validation, and Prediction\nCurrently, I am at phase: In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis.\n\n#############\n# INFORMATION #\nData preview:\n# Data Information\n\n## Data Type\n\n### ID type\n- id\n- CustomerId\n- Surname\n\n### Numerical type\n- CreditScore\n- Age\n- Tenure\n- Balance\n- NumOfProducts\n- HasCrCard\n- IsActiveMember\n- EstimatedSalary\n\n### Categorical type\n- Geography\n- Gender\n\n### Datetime type\n- None\n\n## Detailed data description\nThe provided dataset consists of customer information from a bank, separated into training and test sets. The features include demographic information (such as Geography, Gender, and Age), financial details (such as CreditScore, Balance, and EstimatedSalary), and customer activity indicators (such as NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, and IsActiveMember). \n\n### Notable Patterns and Characteristics:\n- **CreditScore**: Varies significantly among customers, indicating different levels of creditworthiness.\n- **Geography**: Includes customers from France, Spain, and Germany.\n- **Gender**: Data includes both males and females.\n- **Age**: Ranges from young adults to older individuals.\n- **Tenure**: Indicates the number of years the customer has been with the bank.\n- **Balance**: Some customers have a balance of 0, while others have significant balances.\n- **NumOfProducts**: Customers have either 1 or 2 products.\n- **HasCrCard**: Indicates whether a customer has a credit card (1) or not (0).\n- **IsActiveMember**: Indicates whether a customer is an active member (1) or not (0).\n- **EstimatedSalary**: Varies widely among customers.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **Exited**: This is the target variable indicating whether the customer has exited the bank (1) or not (0).\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nFor the submission file, the format should include the `id` and the predicted `Exited` status. The required columns and their types are:\n\n- **id**: Integer (unique identifier for each customer)\n- **Exited**: Integer (prediction of whether the customer has exited the bank, with 1 indicating exit and 0 indicating no exit)\n\nIn this phase, you have `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Conduct thorough statistical analysis on the cleaned data.\n2. Explore relationships between features and the target variable.\n3. Identify potential feature interactions.\n4. Visualize key insights and patterns.\n5. Provide recommendations for Feature Engineering.\n\n\n#############\n# NOTE #\n## PLANNING GUIDELINES ##\n1. Limit the plan to a MAXIMUM of FOUR tasks.\n2. Provide clear methods and constraints for each task.\n3. Focus on critical steps specific to the current phase.\n4. Prioritize methods and values mentioned in USER RULES.\n5. Offer detailed plans without writing actual code.\n6. ONLY focus on tasks relevant to this phase, avoiding those belonging to other phases. For example, during the in-depth EDA phase:\n    - you CAN perform detailed univariate analysis on KEY features.\n    - you CAN NOT modify any feature or modify data.\n\n## DATA OUTPUT PREFERENCES ##\n1. Prioritize TEXT format (print) for statistical information.\n2. Print a description before outputting statistics.\n3. Generate images only if text description is inadequate.\n\n## METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS ##\n1. Provide highly detailed methods, especially for data cleaning.\n2. Specify actions for each feature without omissions.\n\n## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ##\n1. Consider runtime and efficiency, particularly for:\n   - Data visualization\n   - Large dataset handling\n   - Complex algorithms\n2. Limit generated images to a MAXIMUM of 10 for EDA.\n3. Focus on critical visualizations with valuable insights.\n\n## OPTIMIZATION EXAMPLE ##\nWhen using seaborn or matplotlib for large datasets:\n- Turn off unnecessary details (e.g., annot=False in heatmaps)\n- Prioritize efficiency in plot generation\n\n#############\n# TASK #\n\nPlease design plan that is clear and specific to each FEATURE for the current development phase: In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis. \nThe developer will execute tasks based on your plan. \nI will provide you with INFORMATION, RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, and previous reports and plans.\nYou can use the following reasoning pattern to design the plan:\n1. Break down the task into smaller steps.\n2. For each step, ask yourself and answer:\n    - \"What is the objective of this step?\"\n    - \"What are the essential actions to achieve the objective?\"\n    - \"What features are involved in each action?\"\n    - \"Which tool can be used for each action? What are the parameters of the tool?\"\n    - \"What are the expected output of each action? What is the impact of the action on the data?\"\n    - \"What are the constraints of this step?\"\n\n\n#############\n# RESPONSE #\nLet's work this out in a step by step way.\n\n#############\n# START PLANNING #\nBefore you begin, please request the following documents from me, which contain important information that will guide your planning:\n1. Report and plan from the previous phase\n2. Available tools in this phase\n3. Sample data for analysis\n"
