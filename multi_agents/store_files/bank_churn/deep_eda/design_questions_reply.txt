Based on the provided information and plan for the In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis phase, here are six key questions designed to summarize the findings and provide guidance for the next phase of Feature Engineering:

1. **What statistical insights did you gather from the numerical features, and how do these insights inform potential transformations or new feature creation?**  
   *Purpose:* This question aims to summarize the descriptive statistics of numerical features and identify which features may benefit from normalization, scaling, or other transformations to enhance model performance.

2. **How did the categorical features correlate with the target variable `Exited`, and what potential new categorical features could be derived from these insights?**  
   *Purpose:* Understanding the relationship between categorical features and the target variable will help in identifying new categorical features (e.g., combining `Geography` and `Gender`) or encoding strategies for improving model input.

3. **What were the key interactions observed between pairs of features, and how could these interactions be expressed as new features?**  
   *Purpose:* This question focuses on the pair plot analysis findings and aims to highlight which feature interactions might be informative, suggesting possible new features that represent these interactions.

4. **Which features exhibited significant outliers, and how should these outliers be addressed or transformed in the feature engineering phase?**  
   *Purpose:* Identifying outliers is crucial for understanding their impact on model training. This question will guide decisions on how to handle outliers (e.g., capping, removal, or transformation) in the next phase.

5. **What visualizations provided the clearest insights into customer segmentation, and how can these insights translate into new features for modeling?**  
   *Purpose:* This question seeks to summarize which visualizations were most effective in conveying insights about customer behaviors and segments, guiding the creation of features that capture these segments more clearly.

6. **Based on the findings from correlation analysis, which features should be prioritized for engineering, and what specific transformations would optimize their predictive power?**  
   *Purpose:* This question aims to consolidate the correlation analysis results and prioritize features for engineering, focusing on transformations that could enhance the relationships between features and the target variable.

These questions are designed to ensure a smooth transition to the Feature Engineering phase by summarizing the key findings from the current phase and providing actionable insights for the next steps.
