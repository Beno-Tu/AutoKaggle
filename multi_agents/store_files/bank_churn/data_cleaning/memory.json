The train data contains the target variable `Exited`, which indicates whether the customer has exited the bank. The features provided are:\n\n- `id`: Unique identifier for each data point.\n- `CustomerId`: Unique identifier for each customer.\n- `Surname`: Customer's surname, a categorical variable.\n- `CreditScore`: Numerical value representing the customer's credit score.\n- `Geography`: Categorical value indicating the customer's country (France, Spain, Germany).\n- `Gender`: Categorical value indicating the customer's gender (Male, Female).\n- `Age`: Numerical value representing the customer's age.\n- `Tenure`: Numerical value indicating the number of years the customer has been with the bank.\n- `Balance`: Numerical value representing the customer's bank account balance.\n- `NumOfProducts`: Numerical value indicating the number of bank products the customer uses.\n- `HasCrCard`: Numerical value (binary) indicating whether the customer has a credit card (1 for yes, 0 for no).\n- `IsActiveMember`: Numerical value (binary) indicating whether the customer is an active member (1 for yes, 0 for no).\n- `EstimatedSalary`: Numerical value representing the customer's estimated salary.\n\nNotable patterns include:\n- The `Balance` and `EstimatedSalary` fields have a wide range of values, indicating varying financial statuses among customers.\n- The `Geography` and `Gender` fields show categorical diversity.\n- `Age` and `Tenure` have typical ranges expected for a banking customer dataset, with age varying from young adults to middle-aged customers, and tenure indicating how long customers have been with the bank.\n\n## Target Variable\nThe target variable is `Exited`, which indicates whether a customer has exited the bank (1 for exited, 0 for not exited).\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nWhen submitting predictions, the required format should include the following columns:\n- `id`: Unique identifier for each data point.\n- `Exited`: Predicted value indicating whether the customer has exited the bank (1 for exited, 0 for not exited).\n\nExample submission:\n| id      | Exited |\n|---------|--------|\n| 165034  | 0      |\n| 165035  | 1      |\n| ...     | ...    |\n\nIn this phase, you have `train.csv` and `test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Address issues identified in the Preliminary EDA phase.\n2. Handle missing values using appropriate techniques.\n3. Treat outliers and anomalies.\n4. Ensure consistency across both datasets.\n5. Other necessary data cleaning steps.\n6.

A complete list of features in the data.\n3. Any specific tools or functions that are available for use (e.g., `remove_duplicates`, `detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr`, `convert_data_types`).\n\nIf you have this information, please share it. If not, I'll proceed with generic implementations for the tools mentioned in the plan.\n\n### Implementing the Data Cleaning Phase\n\nGiven the constraints and plan, here's how we'll proceed:\n\n1. **Remove Duplicates**\n2. **Detect and Handle Outliers**\n3. **Ensure Consistency in Data Types**\n4. **Align Categorical Values**\n5. **Save Cleaned Data**\n\nLet's get started:\n\n### TASK 1: Remove Duplicates\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will remove duplicate rows from both the training and test datasets to ensure that no redundant data affects our analysis and model performance.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Define the function to remove duplicates\ndef remove_duplicates(data, columns=None, keep='first', inplace=False):\n    return data.drop_duplicates(subset=columns, keep=keep, inplace=inplace)\n\n# Load data\ntrain_data = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/train.csv')\ntest_data = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/test.csv')\n\n# Remove duplicates\ntrain_data = remove_duplicates(data=train_data)\ntest_data = remove_duplicates(data=test_data)\n\n# Print the shape to verify the removal of duplicates\nprint(\"Train data shape after removing duplicates:\", train_data.shape)\nprint(\"Test data shape after removing duplicates:\", test_data.shape)\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n- The `remove_duplicates` function removes duplicate rows from the DataFrame.\n- We load the training and test data from the specified directory.\n- We apply the `remove_duplicates` function to both datasets and verify the shape.\n\n### TASK 2: Detect and Handle Outliers\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will use the IQR method to detect and handle outliers. Outliers will be clipped to the threshold values to minimize their impact on the data distribution.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\ndef detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr(data, columns, factor=1.5, method='clip'):\n    for column in columns:\n        Q1 = data[column].quantile(0.25)\n        Q3 = data[column].quantile(0.75)\n        IQR = Q3 - Q1\n        lower_bound = Q1 - factor * IQR\n        upper_bound = Q3 + factor * IQR\n        \n        if method == 'clip':\n            data[column] = data[column].clip(lower=lower_bound, upper=upper_bound)\n        # Additional methods can be added here\n    return data\n\n# Detect and handle outliers in train and test data\ntrain_data = detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr(data=train_data, columns=['CreditScore', 'Age', 'Tenure', 'Balance', 'EstimatedSalary'])\ntest_data = detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr(data=test_data, columns=['CreditScore', 'Age', 'Tenure', 'Balance', 'EstimatedSalary'])\n\n# Print a summary to verify outliers handling\nprint(\"Outliers handled in train and test data.\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n- The `detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr` function calculates the IQR and clips the data to the lower and upper bounds.\n- We apply this function to the specified numerical columns in both the training and test datasets.\n\n### TASK 3: Ensure Consistency in Data Types\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe need to ensure that numerical columns are of type `float` and binary columns are of type `int`.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\ndef convert_data_types(data, columns, target_type):\n    for column in columns:\n        data[column] = data[column].astype(target_type)\n    return data\n\n# Ensure consistency in data types for train and test data\ntrain_data = convert_data_types(data=train_data, columns=['CreditScore', 'Age', 'Tenure', 'Balance', 'EstimatedSalary'], target_type='float')\ntrain_data = convert_data_types(data=train_data, columns=['HasCrCard', 'IsActiveMember'], target_type='int')\n\ntest_data = convert_data_types(data=test_data, columns=['CreditScore', 'Age', 'Tenure', 'Balance', 'EstimatedSalary'], target_type='float')\ntest_data = convert_data_types(data=test_data, columns=['HasCrCard', 'IsActiveMember'], target_type='int')\n\n# Print data types to verify consistency\nprint(\"Data types after conversion in train data:\\n\", train_data.dtypes)\nprint(\"Data types after conversion in test data:\\n\", test_data.dtypes)\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n- The `convert_data_types` function converts the specified columns to the target data type.\n- We apply this function to ensure numerical columns are `float` and binary columns are `int`.\n\n### TASK 4: Align Categorical Values\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will ensure that the categorical values are consistent across both datasets by converting them to categorical types.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\n# Align categorical values for train and test data\ntrain_data['Geography'] = pd.Categorical(train_data['Geography'])\ntrain_data['Gender'] = pd.Categorical(train_data['Gender'])\n\ntest_data['Geography'] = pd.Categorical(test_data['Geography'])\ntest_data['Gender'] = pd.Categorical(test_data['Gender'])\n\n# Print unique values to verify alignment\nprint(\"Unique values in Geography (train):\", train_data['Geography'].unique())\nprint(\"Unique values in Geography (test):\", test_data['Geography'].unique())\nprint(\"Unique values in Gender (train):\", train_data['Gender'].unique())\nprint(\"Unique values in Gender (test):\", test_data['Gender'].unique())\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n- We convert the `Geography` and `Gender` columns to categorical types using `pd.Categorical`.\n- We print the unique values to verify the alignment of categorical values.\n\n### Final Output: Save Cleaned Data\n\n#### Thought Process:\nAfter cleaning the datasets, we will save them to the specified directory with clear, meaningful names.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\n# Save cleaned data\ntrain_data.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/cleaned_train.csv', index=False)\ntest_data.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/cleaned_test.csv', index=False)\n\nprint(\"Cleaned data saved successfully.\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n- We save the cleaned training and test datasets to the specified directory with the names `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`.\n\n### Summary:\nThe provided code implements the data cleaning phase according to the plan. It includes steps to remove duplicates, handle outliers, ensure consistent data types, align categorical values, and save the cleaned datasets.

Example: To drop specific columns, use the `remove_columns_with_missing_data` tool with appropriate parameters.\n## ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ##\nYou can also use functions from public libraries such as:\n- Pandas\n- NumPy\n- Scikit-learn\n- etc.\n## DETAILED TOOL DESCRIPTIONS ##\n\n## remove_duplicates\n\n**Name:** remove_duplicates  \n**Description:** Remove duplicate rows from a DataFrame. This tool provides flexible options for identifying and handling duplicate entries in a dataset.  \n**Applicable Situations:** remove duplicate entries from a dataset, especially when dealing with data that may have been entered multiple times or when consolidating data from multiple sources\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** A pandas DataFrame object representing the dataset.\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array` | `null``\n  - **Description:** Column label or sequence of labels to consider for identifying duplicates. If None, use all columns.\n  - **Default:** `None`\n- `keep`:\n  - **Type:** `string`\n  - **Description:** Determines which duplicates (if any) to keep.\n  - **Enum:** `first` | `last` | `False`\n  - **Default:** `first`\n- `inplace`:\n  - **Type:** `boolean`\n  - **Description:** Whether to drop duplicates in place or return a copy.\n  - **Default:** `False`\n\n**Required:** `data`  \n**Result:** Successfully remove duplicate rows from the DataFrame  \n**Notes:**\n- If 'columns' is None, all columns are used for identifying duplicates.\n- The 'keep' parameter determines which duplicate rows are retained.\n- Setting 'inplace' to True will modify the original DataFrame.\n- Be cautious when removing duplicates, as it may affect the integrity of your dataset.\n- Consider the impact of removing duplicates on your analysis and model performance.\n- This method is useful for data cleaning, but make sure you understand why duplicates exist before removing them.\n\n\n## detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr\n\n**Name:** detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr  \n**Description:** Detect and handle outliers in specified columns using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. This tool is useful for identifying and managing extreme values in numerical features without assuming a specific distribution of the data.  \n**Applicable Situations:** detect and handle outliers in numerical features, especially when the data distribution is unknown, non-normal, or when the dataset is small or contains extreme outliers\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** A pandas DataFrame object representing the dataset.\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array``\n  - **Description:** The name(s) of the column(s) to check for outliers.\n- `factor`:\n  - **Type:** `number`\n  - **Description:** The IQR factor to determine the outlier threshold. Typically 1.5 for outliers or 3 for extreme outliers.\n  - **Default:** `1.5`\n- `method`:\n  - **Type:** `string`\n  - **Description:** The method to handle outliers.\n  - **Enum:** `clip` | `remove`\n  - **Default:** `clip`\n- `return_mask`:\n  - **Type:** `boolean`\n  - **Description:** If True, return a boolean mask indicating outliers instead of removing them.\n  - **Default:** `False`\n\n**Required:** `data`, `columns`  \n**Result:** Successfully detect and handle outliers in the specified column(s) of data using the IQR method  \n**Notes:**\n- This method does not assume any specific data distribution.\n- It is less sensitive to extreme outliers compared to the Z-score method.\n- May be less precise for normally distributed data compared to the Z-score method.\n- The choice of factor affects the range of what is considered an outlier.\n- Using the 'remove' method may delete data entries, which is not recommended for test sets.\n\n\n## convert_data_types\n\n**Name:** convert_data_types  \n**Description:** Convert the data type of specified columns in a DataFrame. This tool is useful for ensuring data consistency and preparing data for analysis or modeling.  \n**Applicable Situations:** data type conversion, data preprocessing, ensuring data consistency across columns\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** A pandas DataFrame object representing the dataset.\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array``\n  - **Description:** Column label or sequence of labels to convert.\n- `target_type`:\n  - **Type:** `string`\n  - **Description:** The target data type to convert to.\n  - **Enum:** `int` | `float` | `str` | `bool` | `datetime`\n\n**Required:** `data`, `columns`, `target_type`  \n**Result:** Successfully convert the data type of specified column(s) in the DataFrame  \n**Notes:**\n- For 'int' and 'float' conversions, non-numeric values will be converted to NaN.\n- The 'int' conversion uses the 'Int64' type, which supports NaN values.\n- The 'datetime' conversion will set invalid date/time values to NaT (Not a Time).\n- The 'bool' conversion may produce unexpected results for non-boolean data.\n- Consider the impact of type conversion on your data analysis and model performance.\n- Always verify the results after conversion to ensure data integrity.\n\n\n"

It is recommended to check for any missing values before proceeding to the next phase.\n\n### Question 6\nWhat changes were made to ensure data type consistency between the training and testing datasets?\n### Answer 6\n- The following changes were made:\n  - Converted `CreditScore`, `Age`, `Tenure`, `Balance`, `EstimatedSalary` to `float`.\n  - Converted `HasCrCard`, `IsActiveMember` to `int`.\n- Ensured categorical features `Geography` and `Gender` were consistently defined across both datasets.\n\n### Question 7\nWere there any issues with categorical variables, and how were they aligned across both datasets?\n### Answer 7\n- No specific issues were reported with categorical variables. Both `Geography` and `Gender` were aligned by converting them to pandas categorical types, ensuring consistency across both training and testing datasets.\n\n### Question 8\nWhat other notable data cleaning steps were taken that could influence insights during exploratory data analysis?\n### Answer 8\n- Apart from removing duplicates and handling outliers, the following steps were significant:\n  - Ensured data type consistency across both datasets.\n  - Standardized categorical variables to ensure that subsequent analyses do not encounter discrepancies in the data."
