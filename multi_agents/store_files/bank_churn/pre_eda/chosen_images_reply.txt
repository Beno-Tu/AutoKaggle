To effectively conduct a Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we should focus on visualizations that provide insights into the distribution, relationships, and characteristics of the data. Based on the images provided, the following selections will be most relevant:

1. **Boxplots**: These will help us understand the spread and identify any outliers for numerical features.
   - `boxplot_Age.png`
   - `boxplot_Balance.png`
   - `boxplot_CreditScore.png`
   - `boxplot_EstimatedSalary.png`
   - `boxplot_Tenure.png`
   - `boxplot_NumOfProducts.png`

2. **Distribution Plots**: These plots will give us a clearer picture of the distribution of various numerical features, which is essential for understanding the data's characteristics.
   - `distribution_Age.png`
   - `distribution_Balance.png`

3. **Correlation Matrix**: This will provide insights into the relationships between numerical features, which is essential for feature selection in the next phase.

Combining the above, here are the selected images:

```json
{
    "images": [
        "boxplot_Age.png",
        "boxplot_Balance.png",
        "boxplot_CreditScore.png",
        "boxplot_EstimatedSalary.png",
        "boxplot_Tenure.png",
        "boxplot_NumOfProducts.png",
        "distribution_Age.png",
        "correlation_matrix.png"
    ]
}
```
