Understand Background\n2. Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis\n3. Data Cleaning\n4. In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis\n5. Feature Engineering\n6. Model Building, Validation, and Prediction\nCurrently, I am at phase: Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis.\n\n#############\n# INFORMATION #\nData preview:\n# Data Information\n\n## Data Type\n\n### ID type\n- id\n- CustomerId\n\n### Numerical type\n- CreditScore\n- Age\n- Tenure\n- Balance\n- NumOfProducts\n- HasCrCard\n- IsActiveMember\n- EstimatedSalary\n\n### Categorical type\n- Surname\n- Geography\n- Gender\n\n### Datetime type\n- None\n\n## Detailed data description\nThe dataset is split into training and test sets, each containing information about customers of a bank. The training set includes a target variable \"Exited,\" which indicates whether a customer has exited the bank (1) or not (0). Below are some notable observations:\n\n- **CreditScore**: This numerical feature represents the creditworthiness of a customer. Values range from 539 to 845 in the provided data.\n- **Geography**: This categorical feature indicates the country of residence of the customer (France, Spain, Germany).\n- **Gender**: This categorical feature indicates the gender of the customer (Male, Female).\n- **Age**: The age of the customers ranges from 22 to 47 years.\n- **Tenure**: This numerical feature represents the number of years a customer has been with the bank, ranging from 1 to 10 years.\n- **Balance**: This feature represents the bank balance of the customer. It ranges from 0 to 148882.54 in the training data and from 0 to 121263.62 in the test data.\n- **NumOfProducts**: The number of products a customer has purchased from the bank (1 or 2).\n- **HasCrCard**: Indicates whether the customer has a credit card (1) or not (0).\n- **IsActiveMember**: Indicates whether the customer is an active member (1) or not (0).\n- **EstimatedSalary**: The estimated salary of the customer, ranging from 15068.83 to 184866.69 in the training data and from 51907.72 to 160976.75 in the test data.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **Exited**: This is the target variable in the training data. It indicates whether a customer has exited the bank (1) or not (0).\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file format should include the following columns:\n- id (int): Unique identifier for each test data point.\n- Exited (int): The predicted outcome, where 1 indicates the customer has exited and 0 indicates the customer has not exited.\n\nExample:\n| id     | Exited |\n|--------|--------|\n| 165034 | 0      |\n| 165035 | 1      |\n| ...    | ...    |\n\nIn this phase, you have `train.csv` and `test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Perform initial data exploration on both datasets.\n2. Identify basic statistics, data types, and distributions.\n3. Detect potential issues like missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.\n4. Provide insights to guide the subsequent Data Cleaning phase.\n\n\n#############\n# NOTE #\n## PLANNING GUIDELINES ##\n1. Limit the plan to a MAXIMUM of FOUR tasks.\n2. Provide clear methods and constraints for each task.\n3. Focus on critical steps specific to the current phase.\n4. Prioritize methods and values mentioned in USER RULES.\n5. Offer detailed plans without writing actual code.\n6. ONLY focus on tasks relevant to this phase, avoiding those belonging to other phases. For example, during the in-depth EDA phase:\n    - you CAN perform detailed univariate analysis on KEY features.\n    - you CAN NOT modify any feature or modify data.\n\n## DATA OUTPUT PREFERENCES ##\n1. Prioritize TEXT format (print) for statistical information.\n2. Print a description before outputting statistics.\n3. Generate images only if text description is inadequate.\n\n## METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS ##\n1. Provide highly detailed methods, especially for data cleaning.\n2. Specify actions for each feature without omissions.\n\n## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ##\n1. Consider runtime and efficiency, particularly for:\n   - Data visualization\n   - Large dataset handling\n   - Complex algorithms\n2. Limit generated images to a MAXIMUM of 10 for EDA.\n3. Focus on critical visualizations with valuable insights.\n\n## OPTIMIZATION EXAMPLE ##\nWhen using seaborn or matplotlib for large datasets:\n- Turn off unnecessary details (e.g., annot=False in heatmaps)\n- Prioritize efficiency in plot generation\n\n#############\n# TASK #\n\nPlease design plan that is clear and specific to each FEATURE for the current development phase: Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis. \nThe developer will execute tasks based on your plan. \nI will provide you with INFORMATION, RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, and previous reports and plans.\nYou can use the following reasoning pattern to design the plan:\n1. Break down the task into smaller steps.\n2. For each step, ask yourself and answer:\n    - \"What is the objective of this step?\"\n    - \"What are the essential actions to achieve the objective?\"\n    - \"What features are involved in each action?\"\n    - \"Which tool can be used for each action? What are the parameters of the tool?\"\n    - \"What are the expected output of each action? What is the impact of the action on the data?\"\n    - \"What are the constraints of this step?\"\n\n\n#############\n# RESPONSE #\nLet's work this out in a step by step way.\n\n#############\n# START PLANNING #\nBefore you begin, please request the following documents from me, which contain important information that will guide your planning:\n1. Report and plan from the previous phase\n2. Available tools in this phase\n3. Sample data for analysis\n"
