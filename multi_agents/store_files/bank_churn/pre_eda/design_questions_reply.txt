Based on the provided information and plan for the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis phase, here are six key questions designed to summarize findings and guide the transition to the Data Cleaning phase:

1. **What basic statistics did you observe for each feature, and were there any anomalies or unexpected distributions?**
   - *Purpose*: This question helps summarize the general characteristics of each feature, highlighting any anomalies or unexpected values that may need addressing during the cleaning phase.

2. **What percentage of missing values exists in each feature, and which features have the highest rates of missingness?**
   - *Purpose*: Understanding the extent of missing values is crucial for deciding on imputation methods or whether to drop certain features entirely in the Data Cleaning phase.

3. **Which features exhibited outliers, and what methods were used to identify them?**
   - *Purpose*: Identifying outliers can help in recognizing extreme values that may distort analysis or model performance. This question sets the stage for potential outlier treatment in the cleaning phase.

4. **Were there any inconsistencies in the categorical features, such as unexpected categories or incorrect data types?**
   - *Purpose*: This question targets data quality issues within categorical features, which may require standardization or correction to ensure reliability in subsequent analyses.

5. **What correlations were observed between numerical features and the target variable (Exited), and which features showed the strongest relationships?**
   - *Purpose*: Understanding correlations can inform decisions about which features might need more in-depth cleaning or transformation to enhance predictive power in model building.

6. **What initial insights or hypotheses emerged from the exploratory data analysis that could shape the data cleaning strategy?**
   - *Purpose*: This question encourages reflection on any trends or patterns observed that may necessitate specific cleaning actions, such as transformations, binning, or feature engineering, to improve the dataset's quality and usability. 

These questions not only summarize key findings from the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis phase but also provide a clear direction for the Data Cleaning phase, ensuring that important issues are addressed effectively.
