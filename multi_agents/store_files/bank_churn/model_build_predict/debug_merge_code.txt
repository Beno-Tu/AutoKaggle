Certainly! Here is the fully corrected code with the `ERROR CODE SNIPPET` replaced by the `CODE SNIPPET AFTER CORRECTION`:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load processed data
train_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/processed_train.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/processed_test.csv')

# Ensure working on a copy
train_df = train_df.copy()
test_df = test_df.copy()

# Verify the presence of the 'Exited' column
if 'Exited' not in train_df.columns:
    raise KeyError("The target column 'Exited' is missing from the training data.")

# Separate the target variable
y_train = train_df['Exited']
X_train = train_df.drop(columns=['Exited', 'id', 'CustomerId', 'Surname'])
X_test = test_df.drop(columns=['id', 'CustomerId', 'Surname'])

# One-hot encode categorical features
X_train = pd.get_dummies(X_train)
X_test = pd.get_dummies(X_test)

# Align the train and test dataframes by the columns
X_train, X_test = X_train.align(X_test, join='left', axis=1, fill_value=0)

# Verify the shapes of the datasets
print(f"X_train shape: {X_train.shape}")
print(f"y_train shape: {y_train.shape}")
print(f"X_test shape: {X_test.shape}")

# Define the models to be trained
selected_models = ["logistic regression", "random forest", "XGBoost"]

# Train and select the best model
best_model = train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model(
    X=X_train,
    y=y_train,
    problem_type='binary',
    selected_models=selected_models
)

print(f"The best performing model is: {best_model}")

# The validation is already performed within the previous step using the train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model tool.
# No additional code is required for this step as the tool handles validation internally.

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = best_model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]  # get the probability of the positive class

# Prepare the submission DataFrame
submission_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'id': test_df['id'],
    'Exited': predictions
})

# Save the submission file
submission_file_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/submission.csv'
submission_df.to_csv(submission_file_path, index=False)

print(f"Submission file saved to {submission_file_path}")
