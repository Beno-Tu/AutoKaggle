Here are six key questions designed to summarize your current phase of Model Building, Validation, and Prediction, and provide guidance for the next phase (None):

1. **What models were trained, and what were their respective AUC ROC scores during validation?**  
   *Purpose:* This question summarizes the performance of each model, allowing for an understanding of which model performed best and why it may be suitable for future applications or improvements.

2. **What preprocessing steps were taken to prepare the training and test datasets?**  
   *Purpose:* This question highlights the data preparation techniques used, ensuring clarity on how the datasets were transformed and what features were included or excluded.

3. **How did the feature selection impact model performance? Were any features particularly influential?**  
   *Purpose:* Understanding feature importance and the impact of feature selection helps in identifying which attributes are critical for predicting churn, guiding future feature engineering efforts.

4. **Were there any challenges faced during model training or validation, and how were they addressed?**  
   *Purpose:* Documenting challenges provides insights into potential pitfalls and informs future practices or methodologies to avoid similar issues.

5. **What is the final format of the submission file, and does it meet the competition requirements?**  
   *Purpose:* Ensuring that the submission file conforms to the specified format is crucial for the competition's success, and this question confirms readiness for submission.

6. **Based on the findings from this phase, what recommendations would you make for future projects or iterations of this model?**  
   *Purpose:* This question encourages reflection on lessons learned and suggests improvements or new directions for future analyses, guiding the planner in their ongoing data science work.

These questions collectively assess the outcomes of the current phase and provide a comprehensive overview of the modeling efforts, ensuring readiness for any future projects or iterations.
