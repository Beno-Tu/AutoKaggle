### Subtask 2: Develop a New Solution Based on the Previous Experience and Suggestions

#### Task 1: Data Preparation
**THOUGHT PROCESS:**
- Verify the presence of the target column 'Exited'.
- Separate the target variable from the training data.
- Remove non-numeric and irrelevant columns from both training and test data.
- Ensure consistency between training and test datasets.

**CODE:**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load processed data
train_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/processed_train.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/processed_test.csv')

# Ensure working on a copy
train_df = train_df.copy()
test_df = test_df.copy()

# Verify the presence of the 'Exited' column
if 'Exited' not in train_df.columns:
    raise KeyError("The target column 'Exited' is missing from the training data.")

# Separate the target variable
y_train = train_df['Exited']
X_train = train_df.drop(columns=['Exited', 'id', 'CustomerId', 'Surname'])
X_test = test_df.drop(columns=['id', 'CustomerId', 'Surname'])

# Verify the shapes of the datasets
print(f"X_train shape: {X_train.shape}")
print(f"y_train shape: {y_train.shape}")
print(f"X_test shape: {X_test.shape}")
```

**EXPLANATION:**
- The code loads the processed training and test data.
- It ensures the data is handled in copies to avoid unintended modifications.
- It verifies the presence of the target column 'Exited' and raises an error if missing.
- It separates the target variable from the training data (`y_train`).
- It removes the target column and irrelevant columns from both training (`X_train`) and test (`X_test`) datasets.
- It prints the shapes of the resulting datasets to confirm the successful execution of the data preparation steps.

#### Task 2: Model Selection and Training
**THOUGHT PROCESS:**
- Define the models to be trained.
- Use the available `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` tool to train and validate the models.
- Select the best performing model based on AUC ROC scores.

**CODE:**
```python
# Define the models to be trained
selected_models = ["logistic regression", "random forest", "XGBoost"]

# Train and select the best model
best_model = train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model(
    X=X_train,
    y=y_train,
    problem_type='binary',
    selected_models=selected_models
)

print(f"The best performing model is: {best_model}")
```

**EXPLANATION:**
- The code defines a list of models to be considered: logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost.
- It uses the `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` tool to train and validate these models on the prepared training data.
- The tool automatically performs cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, returning the best performing model.
- The best model is printed for reference.

#### Task 3: Model Validation
**THOUGHT PROCESS:**
- Using the same tool, validate the trained models to evaluate their performance.
- The tool should automatically perform cross-validation and return performance metrics.

**CODE:**
```python
# The validation is already performed within the previous step using the train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model tool.
# No additional code is required for this step as the tool handles validation internally.
```

**EXPLANATION:**
- The `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` tool used in Task 2 automatically handles the validation process.
- No additional code is required for this step as the validation is integrated within the model training and selection process.

#### Task 4: Model Prediction
**THOUGHT PROCESS:**
- Use the best-performing model to make predictions on the test set.
- Prepare the submission file in the required format.

**CODE:**
```python
# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = best_model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]  # get the probability of the positive class

# Prepare the submission DataFrame
submission_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'id': test_df['id'],
    'Exited': predictions
})

# Save the submission file
submission_file_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/submission.csv'
submission_df.to_csv(submission_file_path, index=False)

print(f"Submission file saved to {submission_file_path}")
```

**EXPLANATION:**
- The code uses the best-performing model to make predictions on the test data.
- It extracts the probability of the positive class (i.e., the probability of a customer exiting the bank).
- It prepares a DataFrame for submission with the required columns: 'id' and 'Exited'.
- It saves the submission file in the specified directory and prints a confirmation message.

By addressing the issues identified in the analysis and following a structured approach, this solution should effectively complete the model building, validation, and prediction phase for the bank churn competition.
