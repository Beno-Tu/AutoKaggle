### Step 1: Analyze the Error

The error messages indicate that there is a problem with converting string values to floats during the model fitting process. Specifically, the error message `ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'Young'` suggests that the dataset contains categorical data that needs to be encoded before it can be used in the model training process.

### Step 2: Plan the Correction

To fix this issue, we need to encode the categorical features in the `X_train` and `X_test` dataframes. We can use techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding. For simplicity, let's use one-hot encoding using `pd.get_dummies`.

### Step 3: Implement the Correction

Hereâ€™s the corrected code snippet:

```python
# Separate the target variable
y_train = train_df['Exited']
X_train = train_df.drop(columns=['Exited', 'id', 'CustomerId', 'Surname'])
X_test = test_df.drop(columns=['id', 'CustomerId', 'Surname'])

# One-hot encode categorical features
X_train = pd.get_dummies(X_train)
X_test = pd.get_dummies(X_test)

# Align the train and test dataframes by the columns
X_train, X_test = X_train.align(X_test, join='left', axis=1, fill_value=0)

# Define the models to be trained
selected_models = ["logistic regression", "random forest", "XGBoost"]

# Train and select the best model
best_model = train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model(
    X=X_train,
    y=y_train,
    problem_type='binary',
    selected_models=selected_models
)
```

### Explanation

1. **Encoding Categorical Features:**
   - `pd.get_dummies` is used to convert categorical data into one-hot encoded columns.
   - This ensures that all categorical fields are converted into numerical format suitable for model training.

2. **Align Train and Test Data:**
   - `X_train.align(X_test, join='left', axis=1, fill_value=0)` ensures that the train and test datasets have the same columns, filling missing columns with zeros in the test set.

3. **Training the Model:**
   - The code then proceeds to define the models and train them using the `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` function.

This approach ensures that the dataset is properly preprocessed and ready for model training.
