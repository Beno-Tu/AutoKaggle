Understand Background\n2. Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis\n3. Data Cleaning\n4. In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis\n5. Feature Engineering\n6. Model Building, Validation, and Prediction\nCurrently, I am at phase: Model Building, Validation, and Prediction.\n\n#############\n# INFORMATION #\nData preview:\n# Data Information\n\n## Data Type\n\n### ID type\n- id\n- CustomerId\n\n### Numerical type\n- CreditScore\n- Age\n- Tenure\n- Balance\n- NumOfProducts\n- EstimatedSalary\n\n### Categorical type\n- Surname\n- Gender\n- HasCrCard\n- IsActiveMember\n- Exited\n- AgeGroup\n- HasBalance\n- Region_Balance_Interaction\n- Active_Card_User\n- Geography_Germany\n- Geography_Spain\n\n### Datetime type\n- None (There are no datetime features in the provided data)\n\n## Detailed data description\nThe dataset consists of various features related to bank customers, which include both numerical and categorical values. Here is a brief description of the features:\n\n- **id**: Unique identifier for each data point.\n- **CustomerId**: Unique identifier for each customer.\n- **Surname**: Customer's surname.\n- **CreditScore**: Standardized credit score of the customer.\n- **Gender**: Gender of the customer (0: Female, 1: Male).\n- **Age**: Standardized age of the customer.\n- **Tenure**: Number of years the customer has been with the bank.\n- **Balance**: Standardized balance amount in the customer's account.\n- **NumOfProducts**: Number of products the customer has with the bank.\n- **HasCrCard**: Whether the customer has a credit card (1: Yes, 0: No).\n- **IsActiveMember**: Whether the customer is an active member (1: Yes, 0: No).\n- **EstimatedSalary**: Standardized estimated salary of the customer.\n- **Exited**: Whether the customer exited the bank (1: Yes, 0: No). This is the target variable.\n- **AgeGroup**: Categorized age group of the customer (e.g., Young, Middle-aged).\n- **HasBalance**: Whether the customer has a balance (1: Yes, 0: No).\n- **Region_Balance_Interaction**: Interaction term between region and balance.\n- **Active_Card_User**: Interaction term indicating if the customer is an active member with a credit card (1: Yes, 0: No).\n- **Geography_Germany**: Whether the customer is from Germany (1: Yes, 0: No).\n- **Geography_Spain**: Whether the customer is from Spain (1: Yes, 0: No).\n\nNotable patterns:\n- The data has been standardized, with features like CreditScore, Age, Balance, and EstimatedSalary being adjusted to a common scale.\n- There are interaction terms and categorical encodings that might be useful for model improvement.\n- The target variable 'Exited' is binary, indicating customer churn status.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **Exited**: This is the target variable indicating whether the customer exited (churned) from the bank. It is a binary categorical variable with values 1 (Yes) and 0 (No).\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should be in the following format:\n- **id**: Unique identifier for each prediction.\n- **Exited**: Predicted probability of the customer exiting.\n\nExample:\n```\nid,Exited\n165034,0.5\n165035,0.5\n165036,0.5\n165037,0.5\n165038,0.5\n165039,0.5\n165040,0.5\n165041,0.5\n165042,0.5\n165043,0.5\n```\n\nThe evaluation metric for the competition is the area under the ROC curve (AUC), which assesses the model's ability to distinguish between exited and non-exited customers.\n\nIn this phase, you have `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`. You should first train a model on the training set and then make predictions on the test set.\nBefore training the model:\n1. For the training set, separate the target column as y.\n2. Remove the target column and any non-numeric columns (e.g., String-type columns) that cannot be used in model training from the training set.\nBefore making predictions:\n1. For the test set, remove the same columns that were removed from the training set (except the target column, which is not present in the test set).\n2. Ensure consistency between the columns used in training and prediction.\nDue to computational resource limitations, you are allowed to train a maximum of **three** models\n\n#############\n# NOTE #\n## PLANNING GUIDELINES ##\n1. Limit the plan to a MAXIMUM of FOUR tasks.\n2. Provide clear methods and constraints for each task.\n3. Focus on critical steps specific to the current phase.\n4. Prioritize methods and values mentioned in USER RULES.\n5. Offer detailed plans without writing actual code.\n6. ONLY focus on tasks relevant to this phase, avoiding those belonging to other phases. For example, during the in-depth EDA phase:\n    - you CAN perform detailed univariate analysis on KEY features.\n    - you CAN NOT modify any feature or modify data.\n\n## DATA OUTPUT PREFERENCES ##\n1. Prioritize TEXT format (print) for statistical information.\n2. Print a description before outputting statistics.\n3. Generate images only if text description is inadequate.\n\n## METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS ##\n1. Provide highly detailed methods, especially for data cleaning.\n2. Specify actions for each feature without omissions.\n\n## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ##\n1. Consider runtime and efficiency, particularly for:\n   - Data visualization\n   - Large dataset handling\n   - Complex algorithms\n2. Limit generated images to a MAXIMUM of 10 for EDA.\n3. Focus on critical visualizations with valuable insights.\n\n## OPTIMIZATION EXAMPLE ##\nWhen using seaborn or matplotlib for large datasets:\n- Turn off unnecessary details (e.g., annot=False in heatmaps)\n- Prioritize efficiency in plot generation\n\n#############\n# TASK #\n\nPlease design plan that is clear and specific to each FEATURE for the current development phase: Model Building, Validation, and Prediction. \nThe developer will execute tasks based on your plan. \nI will provide you with INFORMATION, RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, and previous reports and plans.\nYou can use the following reasoning pattern to design the plan:\n1. Break down the task into smaller steps.\n2. For each step, ask yourself and answer:\n    - \"What is the objective of this step?\"\n    - \"What are the essential actions to achieve the objective?\"\n    - \"What features are involved in each action?\"\n    - \"Which tool can be used for each action? What are the parameters of the tool?\"\n    - \"What are the expected output of each action? What is the impact of the action on the data?\"\n    - \"What are the constraints of this step?\"\n\n\n#############\n# RESPONSE #\nLet's work this out in a step by step way.\n\n#############\n# START PLANNING #\nBefore you begin, please request the following documents from me, which contain important information that will guide your planning:\n1.
