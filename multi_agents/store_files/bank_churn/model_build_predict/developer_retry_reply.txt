Great! With the information provided, let's proceed with the tasks as planned. Here's the complete code for each task:

### TASK 1: Data Preparation

**Thought Process:**
- Load the processed training and test data.
- Separate the target variable `Exited` from the training data.
- Remove non-numeric and irrelevant columns from both training and test data.

**CODE:**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load processed data
train_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/processed_train.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/processed_test.csv')

# Ensure working on a copy
train_df = train_df.copy()
test_df = test_df.copy()

# Separate the target variable
y_train = train_df['Exited']
X_train = train_df.drop(columns=['Exited', 'id', 'CustomerId', 'Surname'])
X_test = test_df.drop(columns=['id', 'CustomerId', 'Surname'])

# Verify the shapes of the datasets
print(f"X_train shape: {X_train.shape}")
print(f"y_train shape: {y_train.shape}")
print(f"X_test shape: {X_test.shape}")
```
**EXPLANATION:**
- The code loads the processed training and test datasets.
- It separates the target variable `Exited` from the training data.
- Irrelevant columns such as 'id', 'CustomerId', and 'Surname' are removed from both training and test datasets.
- Finally, it prints the shapes of the resulting datasets to verify the changes.

### TASK 2: Model Selection and Training

**Thought Process:**
- Use the provided `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` function to train up to three models: logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost.
- Select the best model based on AUC ROC scores.

**CODE:**
```python
# Define the models to be trained
selected_models = ["logistic regression", "random forest", "XGBoost"]

# Train and select the best model
best_model = train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model(
    X=X_train,
    y=y_train,
    problem_type='binary',
    selected_models=selected_models
)

print(f"The best performing model is: {best_model}")
```
**EXPLANATION:**
- The `selected_models` list specifies the models to be trained.
- The `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` function is called with the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), problem type (`binary`), and selected models (`logistic regression`, `random forest`, `XGBoost`).
- The best performing model is identified and printed.

### TASK 3: Model Validation

**Thought Process:**
- The `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` function already performs cross-validation during model training.
- The best model is selected based on the validation scores, so no additional code is needed for this task.

### TASK 4: Model Prediction

**Thought Process:**
- Use the best-performing model to make predictions on the test set.
- Format the predictions according to the submission requirements.

**CODE:**
```python
# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = best_model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]  # get the probability of the positive class

# Prepare the submission DataFrame
submission_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'id': test_df['id'],
    'Exited': predictions
})

# Save the submission file
submission_file_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/submission.csv'
submission_df.to_csv(submission_file_path, index=False)

print(f"Submission file saved to {submission_file_path}")
```
**EXPLANATION:**
- The best-performing model is used to make predictions on the test set.
- The predicted probabilities of the positive class are extracted.
- A submission DataFrame is created with the required format (`id`, `Exited`).
- The submission file is saved to the specified path.

### Complete Code

Here's the complete code for all tasks consolidated into one script:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load processed data
train_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/processed_train.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/processed_test.csv')

# Ensure working on a copy
train_df = train_df.copy()
test_df = test_df.copy()

# Separate the target variable
y_train = train_df['Exited']
X_train = train_df.drop(columns=['Exited', 'id', 'CustomerId', 'Surname'])
X_test = test_df.drop(columns=['id', 'CustomerId', 'Surname'])

# Verify the shapes of the datasets
print(f"X_train shape: {X_train.shape}")
print(f"y_train shape: {y_train.shape}")
print(f"X_test shape: {X_test.shape}")

# Define the models to be trained
selected_models = ["logistic regression", "random forest", "XGBoost"]

# Train and select the best model
best_model = train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model(
    X=X_train,
    y=y_train,
    problem_type='binary',
    selected_models=selected_models
)

print(f"The best performing model is: {best_model}")

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = best_model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]  # get the probability of the positive class

# Prepare the submission DataFrame
submission_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'id': test_df['id'],
    'Exited': predictions
})

# Save the submission file
submission_file_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/submission.csv'
submission_df.to_csv(submission_file_path, index=False)

print(f"Submission file saved to {submission_file_path}")
```

This script should cover all tasks from data preparation to making predictions and saving the submission file. Ensure that the path and filenames are correctly set as per your project structure.
