Great! With the previous report and the available information, we can create a detailed plan for the Feature Engineering phase. We'll break down the task into four key steps, focusing on creating new features, transforming existing features, handling categorical variables, and normalizing/standardizing numerical features.

### **Feature Engineering Plan**

#### **Step 1: Create New Features Based on Insights from In-depth EDA**
**Objective:** Generate new features that capture important patterns and interactions observed in the exploratory data analysis.
**Actions:**
1. **Create Age Bins:**
   - **Feature Involved:** `Age`
   - **Method:** Bin ages into categories such as 'Young' (18-30), 'Middle-aged' (31-50), and 'Senior' (51+).
   - **Tool:** `pd.cut()`
   - **Expected Output:** New categorical feature `AgeGroup`.

2. **Create Balance Indicator:**
   - **Feature Involved:** `Balance`
   - **Method:** Create a binary feature indicating whether the balance is positive.
   - **Tool:** `np.where()`
   - **Expected Output:** New binary feature `HasBalance`.

3. **Interaction Features:**
   - **Feature Involved:** `Geography`, `Balance`
   - **Method:** Create interaction features like `Region_Balance_Interaction` by combining `Geography` and `Balance`.
   - **Tool:** Custom function using `pd.DataFrame.apply()`
   - **Expected Output:** New feature `Region_Balance_Interaction`.

4. **Active Card User:**
   - **Feature Involved:** `HasCrCard`, `IsActiveMember`
   - **Method:** Create a feature `Active_Card_User` which is 1 if both `HasCrCard` and `IsActiveMember` are 1, else 0.
   - **Tool:** `np.where()`
   - **Expected Output:** New binary feature `Active_Card_User`.

#### **Step 2: Transform Existing Features to Improve Model Performance**
**Objective:** Apply transformations to numerical features to make them more suitable for modeling.
**Actions:**
1. **Normalize CreditScore:**
   - **Feature Involved:** `CreditScore`
   - **Method:** Normalize the `CreditScore` to a 0-1 range.
   - **Tool:** `MinMaxScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`
   - **Expected Output:** Transformed `CreditScore`.

2. **Log Transform EstimatedSalary:**
   - **Feature Involved:** `EstimatedSalary`
   - **Method:** Apply logarithmic transformation to reduce skewness.
   - **Tool:** `np.log1p()`
   - **Expected Output:** Transformed `EstimatedSalary`.

#### **Step 3: Handle Categorical Variables**
**Objective:** Encode categorical variables into numerical format suitable for modeling.
**Actions:**
1. **One-Hot Encode Geography:**
   - **Feature Involved:** `Geography`
   - **Method:** Apply one-hot encoding to convert `Geography` into binary variables.
   - **Tool:** `pd.get_dummies()`
   - **Expected Output:** New binary features for each category in `Geography`.

2. **Encode Gender:**
   - **Feature Involved:** `Gender`
   - **Method:** Convert `Gender` to binary (0 for Female, 1 for Male).
   - **Tool:** `LabelEncoder` from `sklearn.preprocessing`
   - **Expected Output:** Binary feature `Gender`.

#### **Step 4: Normalize or Standardize Numerical Features**
**Objective:** Ensure numerical features are on a similar scale to improve model performance.
**Actions:**
1. **Standardize Age:**
   - **Feature Involved:** `Age`
   - **Method:** Standardize `Age` to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
   - **Tool:** `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`
   - **Expected Output:** Standardized `Age`.

2. **Standardize Balance:**
   - **Feature Involved:** `Balance`
   - **Method:** Standardize `Balance` to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
   - **Tool:** `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`
   - **Expected Output:** Standardized `Balance`.

### **Expected Output**
- **Processed Train Data:** `processed_train.csv`
- **Processed Test Data:** `processed_test.csv`

### **Constraints**
1. **Runtime Efficiency:** Ensure that the processing time is minimized, especially for large datasets.
2. **Reproducibility:** Document the transformations clearly so they can be consistently applied to both train and test datasets.
3. **Tool Availability:** Use commonly available libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.

By following these steps, we can effectively engineer features that will enhance the predictive power of our models. This structured and detailed approach ensures that we cover all critical aspects of feature engineering specific to the bank churn dataset.
