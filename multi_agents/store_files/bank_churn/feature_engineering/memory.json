Understand Background\n2. Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis\n3. Data Cleaning\n4. In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis\n5. Feature Engineering\n6. Model Building, Validation, and Prediction\nCurrently, I am at phase: Feature Engineering.\n\n#############\n# INFORMATION #\nData preview:\n# Data Information\n\n## Data Type\n\n### ID type\n- id\n- CustomerId\n- Surname\n\n### Numerical type\n- CreditScore\n- Age\n- Tenure\n- Balance\n- NumOfProducts\n- HasCrCard\n- IsActiveMember\n- EstimatedSalary\n\n### Categorical type\n- Geography\n- Gender\n\n### Datetime type\n- None\n\n## Detailed data description\nThe dataset consists of customer information from a bank, including both demographic details and banking activity. Here\u2019s a brief breakdown of the key features:\n\n- **id**: Unique identifier for each record.\n- **CustomerId**: Unique identifier for each customer.\n- **Surname**: The surname of the customer.\n- **CreditScore**: Numerical value representing the creditworthiness of the customer.\n- **Geography**: The country where the customer resides (France, Spain, Germany).\n- **Gender**: The gender of the customer (Male, Female).\n- **Age**: Age of the customer.\n- **Tenure**: Number of years the customer has been with the bank.\n- **Balance**: The account balance of the customer.\n- **NumOfProducts**: Number of products the customer has purchased through the bank.\n- **HasCrCard**: Indicates if the customer has a credit card (1 if yes, 0 if no).\n- **IsActiveMember**: Indicates if the customer is an active member (1 if yes, 0 if no).\n- **EstimatedSalary**: The estimated annual salary of the customer.\n\n### Notable Patterns and Characteristics\n- The **CreditScore** ranges widely across customers, reflecting varied creditworthiness.\n- **Age** distribution shows a mix of younger and older customers.\n- **Balance** includes customers with zero balance and those with substantial amounts.\n- **NumOfProducts** generally varies between 1 and 2.\n- **HasCrCard** and **IsActiveMember** are binary features.\n- **EstimatedSalary** also varies widely, indicating a diverse customer base in terms of income.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **Exited**: This target variable indicates whether a customer has exited the bank (1 if yes, 0 if no).\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should include the following columns:\n- **id**: Unique identifier for each record (Integer).\n- **Exited**: Prediction of whether the customer has exited the bank (Binary: 0 or 1).\n\nIn this phase, you have `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Create new features based on insights from the In-depth EDA.\n2. Transform existing features to improve model performance.\n3. Handle categorical variables (e.g., encoding).\n4. Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.\n5. Select the most relevant features for modeling if necessary.\n6. Other necessary feature engineering steps.\n7. Create `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`.\nOutput: Processed datasets (processed_train.csv and processed_test.csv).\n\n#############\n# NOTE #\n## PLANNING GUIDELINES ##\n1. Limit the plan to a MAXIMUM of FOUR tasks.\n2. Provide clear methods and constraints for each task.\n3. Focus on critical steps specific to the current phase.\n4. Prioritize methods and values mentioned in USER RULES.\n5. Offer detailed plans without writing actual code.\n6. ONLY focus on tasks relevant to this phase, avoiding those belonging to other phases. For example, during the in-depth EDA phase:\n    - you CAN perform detailed univariate analysis on KEY features.\n    - you CAN NOT modify any feature or modify data.\n\n## DATA OUTPUT PREFERENCES ##\n1. Prioritize TEXT format (print) for statistical information.\n2. Print a description before outputting statistics.\n3. Generate images only if text description is inadequate.\n\n## METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS ##\n1. Provide highly detailed methods, especially for data cleaning.\n2. Specify actions for each feature without omissions.\n\n## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ##\n1. Consider runtime and efficiency, particularly for:\n   - Data visualization\n   - Large dataset handling\n   - Complex algorithms\n2. Limit generated images to a MAXIMUM of 10 for EDA.\n3. Focus on critical visualizations with valuable insights.\n\n## OPTIMIZATION EXAMPLE ##\nWhen using seaborn or matplotlib for large datasets:\n- Turn off unnecessary details (e.g., annot=False in heatmaps)\n- Prioritize efficiency in plot generation\n\n#############\n# TASK #\n\nPlease design plan that is clear and specific to each FEATURE for the current development phase: Feature Engineering. \nThe developer will execute tasks based on your plan. \nI will provide you with INFORMATION, RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, and previous reports and plans.\nYou can use the following reasoning pattern to design the plan:\n1. Break down the task into smaller steps.\n2. For each step, ask yourself and answer:\n    - \"What is the objective of this step?\"\n    - \"What are the essential actions to achieve the objective?\"\n    - \"What features are involved in each action?\"\n    - \"Which tool can be used for each action? What are the parameters of the tool?\"\n    - \"What are the expected output of each action? What is the impact of the action on the data?\"\n    - \"What are the constraints of this step?\"\n\n\n#############\n# RESPONSE #\nLet's work this out in a step by step way.\n\n#############\n# START PLANNING #\nBefore you begin, please request the following documents from me, which contain important information that will guide your planning:\n1. Report and plan from the previous phase\n2. Available tools in this phase\n3. Sample data for analysis\n"

What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations.\n### Answer 2\n- **Features Involved:**\n  - **Numerical Features:** `CreditScore`, `Age`, `Tenure`, `Balance`, `NumOfProducts`, `HasCrCard`, `IsActiveMember`, `EstimatedSalary`\n  - **Categorical Features:** `Geography`, `Gender`, `Exited`\n\n- **Changes:**\n  - **Statistical Analysis:** No features were deleted, but descriptive statistics and visualizations were generated for all involved features.\n  - **Correlation Analysis:** Correlation matrix computed; no features were modified or deleted.\n  - **Visualizations:** Plots were created to visualize distributions, relationships with the target variable, and feature interactions.\n\n### Question 3\nWhat statistical insights did you gather from the numerical features, and how do these insights inform potential transformations or new feature creation?\n### Answer 3\n- **Insights:**\n  - **CreditScore:** Ranges from 427 to 850, indicating varying creditworthiness. Potential transformation: normalization or standardization.\n  - **Age:** Median age around 37, with outliers suggesting a need for age groupings (e.g., young, middle-aged, senior).\n  - **Balance:** Significant variation with many zeros; consider creating a binary feature indicating whether a customer has a positive balance.\n  - **EstimatedSalary:** Wide range; consider logarithmic transformation to reduce skewness.\n\n### Question 4\nHow did the categorical features correlate with the target variable `Exited`, and what potential new categorical features could be derived from these insights?\n### Answer 4\n- **Insights:**\n  - **Geography:** Different exit rates among countries, suggesting potential geographical segmentation.\n  - **Gender:** Analyzed against exit status; potential for creating a feature combining gender and geography.\n  - **HasCrCard & IsActiveMember:** Both show distinct distributions in exit status; could create an interaction feature (e.g., `Active_Card_User`).\n\n### Question 5\nWhat were the key interactions observed between pairs of features, and how could these interactions be expressed as new features?\n### Answer 5\n- **Key Interactions:**\n  - **Age and Balance:** Older customers tend to have higher balances and exit rates. Potential new feature: `Age_Balance_Ratio`.\n  - **Geography and Balance:** Different geographical regions show different balance distributions. Potential new feature: `Region_Balance_Interaction`.\n  \n### Question 6\nBased on the findings from correlation analysis, which features should be prioritized for engineering, and what specific transformations would optimize their predictive power?\n### Answer 6\n- **Prioritized Features:**\n  - **Age:** Consider binning into categories for better modeling.\n  - **Balance:** Create a binary feature indicating whether the balance is zero.\n  - **CreditScore:** Normalize or standardize to improve model performance.\n  - **Geography & Gender:** One-hot encode to capture categorical relationships effectively.\n\n#############\n# TARGET VARIABLE #\n['Exited']\n#############\n# CLEANED TRAIN DATA WITH FEATURES #\nid,CustomerId,Surname,CreditScore,Geography,Gender,Age,Tenure,Balance,NumOfProducts,HasCrCard,IsActiveMember,EstimatedSalary,Exited\n\n#############\n# CLEANED TEST DATA WITH FEATURES #\nid,CustomerId,Surname,CreditScore,Geography,Gender,Age,Tenure,Balance,NumOfProducts,HasCrCard,IsActiveMember,EstimatedSalary\n# AVAILABLE TOOLS #\nThere is no pre-defined tools in this phase.

Data Saving:\n   - Save image files in the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/feature_engineering/images/` directory.\n   - Save data files in the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/` directory.\n   - Use clear, meaningful names for image files that reflect their content.\n   - Do NOT use special characters like `/` or spaces in file names.\n   - Save specific files for each phase:\n     - Data Cleaning: `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`\n     - Feature Engineering: `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`\n\n3. Data Processing:\n   - Always work on a copy of the DataFrame, not the original.\n   - Ensure correct data types for all columns before any operations.\n   - Apply consistent modifications (e.g., scaling, encoding) to both training and test sets.\n   - Take care with target-dependent operations on the test set, which lacks the target variable.\n   - Do NOT modify Id-type columns.\n\n## CODING PRACTICES ##\n1. General Rules:\n   - Use `print()` for outputting values.\n   - Avoid writing `assert` statements.\n\n2. Visualization:\n   - Use `plt.close()` after saving each image.\n   - Limit EDA visualizations to 10 or fewer, focusing on the most insightful.\n   - Optimize for large datasets (e.g., `annot=False` in seaborn heatmaps).\n\n3. Efficiency:\n   - Prioritize runtime efficiency, especially for:\n     - Data visualization\n     - Large dataset handling\n     - Complex algorithms\n\n## EXAMPLES ##\n- Before calculating a correlation matrix, ensure all data is numerical. Handle non-numerical data appropriately.\n- Verify consistent data types across columns before merging or joining operations.\n\nRemember: Always consider resource constraints and prioritize efficiency in your code.\n"

Available tools (I assume we are using standard Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc.)\n\nSince you have provided the necessary data features and details about the tools, I will proceed with the implementation. Let's start with the provided plan for feature engineering.\n\n### STEP 1: Create New Features Based on Insights from In-depth EDA\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will create new features such as `AgeGroup`, `HasBalance`, `Region_Balance_Interaction`, and `Active_Card_User`. This will involve binning, conditional creation, and interaction features.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load cleaned data\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/cleaned_train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/cleaned_test.csv')\n\n# Ensure working on a copy\ntrain_df = train_df.copy()\ntest_df = test_df.copy()\n\n# Create AgeGroup feature\nage_bins = [18, 30, 50, np.inf]\nage_labels = ['Young', 'Middle-aged', 'Senior']\ntrain_df['AgeGroup'] = pd.cut(train_df['Age'], bins=age_bins, labels=age_labels)\ntest_df['AgeGroup'] = pd.cut(test_df['Age'], bins=age_bins, labels=age_labels)\n\n# Create HasBalance feature\ntrain_df['HasBalance'] = np.where(train_df['Balance'] > 0, 1, 0)\ntest_df['HasBalance'] = np.where(test_df['Balance'] > 0, 1, 0)\n\n# Create Region_Balance_Interaction feature\ntrain_df['Region_Balance_Interaction'] = train_df['Geography'] + '_' + train_df['HasBalance'].astype(str)\ntest_df['Region_Balance_Interaction'] = test_df['Geography'] + '_' + test_df['HasBalance'].astype(str)\n\n# Create Active_Card_User feature\ntrain_df['Active_Card_User'] = np.where((train_df['HasCrCard'] == 1) & (train_df['IsActiveMember'] == 1), 1, 0)\ntest_df['Active_Card_User'] = np.where((test_df['HasCrCard'] == 1) & (test_df['IsActiveMember'] == 1), 1, 0)\n\n# Verify new features\nprint(train_df[['AgeGroup', 'HasBalance', 'Region_Balance_Interaction', 'Active_Card_User']].head())\nprint(test_df[['AgeGroup', 'HasBalance', 'Region_Balance_Interaction', 'Active_Card_User']].head())\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code creates new features based on the provided plan. `AgeGroup` bins ages into three categories, `HasBalance` indicates whether the balance is positive, `Region_Balance_Interaction` combines geography and balance status, and `Active_Card_User` identifies active card users.\n\n### STEP 2: Transform Existing Features to Improve Model Performance\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will normalize the `CreditScore` and apply a log transform to `EstimatedSalary` to improve model performance.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n\n# Normalize CreditScore\nscaler = MinMaxScaler()\ntrain_df['CreditScore'] = scaler.fit_transform(train_df[['CreditScore']])\ntest_df['CreditScore'] = scaler.transform(test_df[['CreditScore']])\n\n# Log transform EstimatedSalary\ntrain_df['EstimatedSalary'] = np.log1p(train_df['EstimatedSalary'])\ntest_df['EstimatedSalary'] = np.log1p(test_df['EstimatedSalary'])\n\n# Verify transformations\nprint(train_df[['CreditScore', 'EstimatedSalary']].head())\nprint(test_df[['CreditScore', 'EstimatedSalary']].head())\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code normalizes `CreditScore` using MinMaxScaler and applies a logarithmic transformation to `EstimatedSalary` to handle skewness and wide range values.\n\n### STEP 3: Handle Categorical Variables\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will encode categorical features `Geography` using one-hot encoding and `Gender` using label encoding.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n\n# One-Hot Encode Geography\ntrain_df = pd.get_dummies(train_df, columns=['Geography'], drop_first=True)\ntest_df = pd.get_dummies(test_df, columns=['Geography'], drop_first=True)\n\n# Encode Gender\nle = LabelEncoder()\ntrain_df['Gender'] = le.fit_transform(train_df['Gender'])\ntest_df['Gender'] = le.transform(test_df['Gender'])\n\n# Verify encoding\nprint(train_df.head())\nprint(test_df.head())\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code uses one-hot encoding for `Geography` and label encoding for `Gender`. The `drop_first=True` parameter avoids the dummy variable trap by dropping one category.\n\n### STEP 4: Normalize or Standardize Numerical Features\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will standardize the `Age` and `Balance` features to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\n# Standardize Age and Balance\nscaler_age_balance = StandardScaler()\ntrain_df[['Age', 'Balance']] = scaler_age_balance.fit_transform(train_df[['Age', 'Balance']])\ntest_df[['Age', 'Balance']] = scaler_age_balance.transform(test_df[['Age', 'Balance']])\n\n# Verify standardization\nprint(train_df[['Age', 'Balance']].head())\nprint(test_df[['Age', 'Balance']].head())\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code standardizes `Age` and `Balance` using StandardScaler to ensure these features have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.\n\n### Save Processed Data\nFinally, we will save the processed datasets to the specified directory.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\n# Save processed data\ntrain_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/processed_train.csv', index=False)\ntest_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/processed_test.csv', index=False)\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code saves the processed training and test datasets to the specified directory, ensuring the filenames are consistent with the provided constraints.\n\nWith these steps, we have completed the feature engineering phase as per the plan. The processed data is now ready for the next phase: Model Building, Validation, and Prediction."

Now that I have the code from the previous phase and the details about the target variable, let's proceed with the feature engineering phase as outlined in the plan.\n\n### STEP 1: Create New Features Based on Insights\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will create new features such as `AgeGroup`, `HasBalance`, `Region_Balance_Interaction`, and `Active_Card_User` using the provided columns and conditions.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load cleaned data\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/cleaned_train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/cleaned_test.csv')\n\n# Ensure working on a copy\ntrain_df = train_df.copy()\ntest_df = test_df.copy()\n\n# Create AgeGroup feature\nage_bins = [18, 30, 50, np.inf]\nage_labels = ['Young', 'Middle-aged', 'Senior']\ntrain_df['AgeGroup'] = pd.cut(train_df['Age'], bins=age_bins, labels=age_labels)\ntest_df['AgeGroup'] = pd.cut(test_df['Age'], bins=age_bins, labels=age_labels)\n\n# Create HasBalance feature\ntrain_df['HasBalance'] = np.where(train_df['Balance'] > 0, 1, 0)\ntest_df['HasBalance'] = np.where(test_df['Balance'] > 0, 1, 0)\n\n# Create Region_Balance_Interaction feature\ntrain_df['Region_Balance_Interaction'] = train_df['Geography'] + '_' + train_df['HasBalance'].astype(str)\ntest_df['Region_Balance_Interaction'] = test_df['Geography'] + '_' + test_df['HasBalance'].astype(str)\n\n# Create Active_Card_User feature\ntrain_df['Active_Card_User'] = np.where((train_df['HasCrCard'] == 1) & (train_df['IsActiveMember'] == 1), 1, 0)\ntest_df['Active_Card_User'] = np.where((test_df['HasCrCard'] == 1) & (test_df['IsActiveMember'] == 1), 1, 0)\n\n# Verify new features\nprint(train_df[['AgeGroup', 'HasBalance', 'Region_Balance_Interaction', 'Active_Card_User']].head())\nprint(test_df[['AgeGroup', 'HasBalance', 'Region_Balance_Interaction', 'Active_Card_User']].head())\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code creates new features based on the provided plan. `AgeGroup` bins ages into three categories, `HasBalance` indicates whether the balance is positive, `Region_Balance_Interaction` combines geography and balance status, and `Active_Card_User` identifies active card users.\n\n### STEP 2: Transform Existing Features to Improve Model Performance\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will normalize the `CreditScore` and apply a log transform to `EstimatedSalary` to improve model performance.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n\n# Normalize CreditScore\nscaler = MinMaxScaler()\ntrain_df['CreditScore'] = scaler.fit_transform(train_df[['CreditScore']])\ntest_df['CreditScore'] = scaler.transform(test_df[['CreditScore']])\n\n# Log transform EstimatedSalary\ntrain_df['EstimatedSalary'] = np.log1p(train_df['EstimatedSalary'])\ntest_df['EstimatedSalary'] = np.log1p(test_df['EstimatedSalary'])\n\n# Verify transformations\nprint(train_df[['CreditScore', 'EstimatedSalary']].head())\nprint(test_df[['CreditScore', 'EstimatedSalary']].head())\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code normalizes `CreditScore` using MinMaxScaler and applies a logarithmic transformation to `EstimatedSalary` to handle skewness and wide range values.\n\n### STEP 3: Handle Categorical Variables\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will encode categorical features `Geography` using one-hot encoding and `Gender` using label encoding.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n\n# One-Hot Encode Geography\ntrain_df = pd.get_dummies(train_df, columns=['Geography'], drop_first=True)\ntest_df = pd.get_dummies(test_df, columns=['Geography'], drop_first=True)\n\n# Encode Gender\nle = LabelEncoder()\ntrain_df['Gender'] = le.fit_transform(train_df['Gender'])\ntest_df['Gender'] = le.transform(test_df['Gender'])\n\n# Verify encoding\nprint(train_df.head())\nprint(test_df.head())\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code uses one-hot encoding for `Geography` and label encoding for `Gender`. The `drop_first=True` parameter avoids the dummy variable trap by dropping one category.\n\n### STEP 4: Normalize or Standardize Numerical Features\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will standardize the `Age` and `Balance` features to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\n# Standardize Age and Balance\nscaler_age_balance = StandardScaler()\ntrain_df[['Age', 'Balance']] = scaler_age_balance.fit_transform(train_df[['Age', 'Balance']])\ntest_df[['Age', 'Balance']] = scaler_age_balance.transform(test_df[['Age', 'Balance']])\n\n# Verify standardization\nprint(train_df[['Age', 'Balance']].head())\nprint(test_df[['Age', 'Balance']].head())\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code standardizes `Age` and `Balance` using StandardScaler to ensure these features have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.\n\n### Save Processed Data\nFinally, we will save the processed datasets to the specified directory.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\n# Save processed data\ntrain_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/processed_train.csv', index=False)\ntest_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/processed_test.csv', index=False)\n\nprint(\"Processed data saved successfully.\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code saves the processed training and test datasets to the specified directory, ensuring the filenames are consistent with the provided constraints.\n\nWith these steps, we have completed the feature engineering phase as per the plan. The processed data is now ready for the next phase: Model Building, Validation, and Prediction.\n</EXECUTION RESULT>\n\n"
