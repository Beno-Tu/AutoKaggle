Now that I have the code from the previous phase and the details about the target variable, let's proceed with the feature engineering phase as outlined in the plan.\n\n### STEP 1: Create New Features Based on Insights\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will create new features such as `AgeGroup`, `HasBalance`, `Region_Balance_Interaction`, and `Active_Card_User` using the provided columns and conditions.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load cleaned data\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/cleaned_train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/cleaned_test.csv')\n\n# Ensure working on a copy\ntrain_df = train_df.copy()\ntest_df = test_df.copy()\n\n# Create AgeGroup feature\nage_bins = [18, 30, 50, np.inf]\nage_labels = ['Young', 'Middle-aged', 'Senior']\ntrain_df['AgeGroup'] = pd.cut(train_df['Age'], bins=age_bins, labels=age_labels)\ntest_df['AgeGroup'] = pd.cut(test_df['Age'], bins=age_bins, labels=age_labels)\n\n# Create HasBalance feature\ntrain_df['HasBalance'] = np.where(train_df['Balance'] > 0, 1, 0)\ntest_df['HasBalance'] = np.where(test_df['Balance'] > 0, 1, 0)\n\n# Create Region_Balance_Interaction feature\ntrain_df['Region_Balance_Interaction'] = train_df['Geography'] + '_' + train_df['HasBalance'].astype(str)\ntest_df['Region_Balance_Interaction'] = test_df['Geography'] + '_' + test_df['HasBalance'].astype(str)\n\n# Create Active_Card_User feature\ntrain_df['Active_Card_User'] = np.where((train_df['HasCrCard'] == 1) & (train_df['IsActiveMember'] == 1), 1, 0)\ntest_df['Active_Card_User'] = np.where((test_df['HasCrCard'] == 1) & (test_df['IsActiveMember'] == 1), 1, 0)\n\n# Verify new features\nprint(train_df[['AgeGroup', 'HasBalance', 'Region_Balance_Interaction', 'Active_Card_User']].head())\nprint(test_df[['AgeGroup', 'HasBalance', 'Region_Balance_Interaction', 'Active_Card_User']].head())\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code creates new features based on the provided plan. `AgeGroup` bins ages into three categories, `HasBalance` indicates whether the balance is positive, `Region_Balance_Interaction` combines geography and balance status, and `Active_Card_User` identifies active card users.\n\n### STEP 2: Transform Existing Features to Improve Model Performance\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will normalize the `CreditScore` and apply a log transform to `EstimatedSalary` to improve model performance.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n\n# Normalize CreditScore\nscaler = MinMaxScaler()\ntrain_df['CreditScore'] = scaler.fit_transform(train_df[['CreditScore']])\ntest_df['CreditScore'] = scaler.transform(test_df[['CreditScore']])\n\n# Log transform EstimatedSalary\ntrain_df['EstimatedSalary'] = np.log1p(train_df['EstimatedSalary'])\ntest_df['EstimatedSalary'] = np.log1p(test_df['EstimatedSalary'])\n\n# Verify transformations\nprint(train_df[['CreditScore', 'EstimatedSalary']].head())\nprint(test_df[['CreditScore', 'EstimatedSalary']].head())\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code normalizes `CreditScore` using MinMaxScaler and applies a logarithmic transformation to `EstimatedSalary` to handle skewness and wide range values.\n\n### STEP 3: Handle Categorical Variables\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will encode categorical features `Geography` using one-hot encoding and `Gender` using label encoding.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n\n# One-Hot Encode Geography\ntrain_df = pd.get_dummies(train_df, columns=['Geography'], drop_first=True)\ntest_df = pd.get_dummies(test_df, columns=['Geography'], drop_first=True)\n\n# Encode Gender\nle = LabelEncoder()\ntrain_df['Gender'] = le.fit_transform(train_df['Gender'])\ntest_df['Gender'] = le.transform(test_df['Gender'])\n\n# Verify encoding\nprint(train_df.head())\nprint(test_df.head())\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code uses one-hot encoding for `Geography` and label encoding for `Gender`. The `drop_first=True` parameter avoids the dummy variable trap by dropping one category.\n\n### STEP 4: Normalize or Standardize Numerical Features\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will standardize the `Age` and `Balance` features to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\n# Standardize Age and Balance\nscaler_age_balance = StandardScaler()\ntrain_df[['Age', 'Balance']] = scaler_age_balance.fit_transform(train_df[['Age', 'Balance']])\ntest_df[['Age', 'Balance']] = scaler_age_balance.transform(test_df[['Age', 'Balance']])\n\n# Verify standardization\nprint(train_df[['Age', 'Balance']].head())\nprint(test_df[['Age', 'Balance']].head())\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code standardizes `Age` and `Balance` using StandardScaler to ensure these features have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.\n\n### Save Processed Data\nFinally, we will save the processed datasets to the specified directory.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\n# Save processed data\ntrain_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/processed_train.csv', index=False)\ntest_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/bank_churn/processed_test.csv', index=False)\n\nprint(\"Processed data saved successfully.\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code saves the processed training and test datasets to the specified directory, ensuring the filenames are consistent with the provided constraints.\n\nWith these steps, we have completed the feature engineering phase as per the plan. The processed data is now ready for the next phase: Model Building, Validation, and Prediction.\n</EXECUTION RESULT>\n\n"
