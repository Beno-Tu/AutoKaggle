The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge. The challenges will generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\n### Synthetically-Generated Datasets\n\nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\n### Prizes\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\n- 1st Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise\n- 2nd Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise\n- 3rd Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise\n\n**Please note:**\u00a0In order to encourage more participation from beginners, Kaggle merchandise will only be awarded once per person in this series.

It contains information on bank customers who either left the bank or continue to be a customer. The dataset includes the following attributes:\n\n1. id\n2. CustomerId: A unique identifier for each customer\n3. Surname: The customer's surname or last name\n4. CreditScore: A numerical value representing the customer's credit score\n5. Geography: The country where the customer resides (France, Spain or Germany)\n6. Gender: The customer's gender (Male or Female)\n7. Age: The customer's age.\n8. Tenure: The number of years the customer has been with the bank\n9. Balance: The customer's account balance\n10. NumOfProducts: The number of bank products the customer uses (e.g., savings account, credit card)\n11. HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = yes, 0 = no)\n12. IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = yes, 0 = no)\n13. EstimatedSalary: The estimated salary of the customer\n14. Exited: Whether the customer has churned (1 = yes, 0 = no)\n    </overview>\n</INPUT>\n<EXECUTION RESULT>\n```markdown\n# Competition Information\n## 1. Competition Overview\nThe \"bank_churn\" competition is a binary classification challenge aimed at predicting whether a bank customer will continue their account or close it (churn). It is part of the Kaggle Playground Series, designed to help participants practice machine learning skills using synthetic datasets. The competition runs from January 2, 2024, to February 1, 2024, with submissions evaluated based on the area under the ROC curve (AUC).\n\n## 2. Files\n- **train.csv**: Contains the training dataset with features and the binary target variable `Exited`.\n- **test.csv**: Contains the test dataset without the target variable; participants must predict the probability of `Exited`.\n- **sample_submission.csv**: A template illustrating the required format for submissions.\n\n## 3. Problem Definition\nThe objective is to predict the likelihood of customer churn (whether a customer exits the bank) based on various features. Participants must develop a model that outputs predicted probabilities for the `Exited` variable in the test set.\n\n## 4. Data Information\n### 4.1 Data type\n#### 4.1.1 ID type\n- `id`: Unique identifier for each entry.\n- `CustomerId`: Unique identifier for each customer.\n  \n#### 4.1.2 Numerical type\n- `CreditScore`\n- `Age`\n- `Tenure`\n- `Balance`\n- `NumOfProducts`\n- `HasCrCard`\n- `IsActiveMember`\n- `EstimatedSalary`\n- `Exited` (only in training data)\n\n#### 4.1.3 Categorical type\n- `Geography`\n- `Gender`\n\n#### 4.1.4 Datetime type\n- None.\n\n### 4.2 Detailed data description\nThe dataset comprises customer information, including demographic details, banking behavior, and account status. Most customers have credit scores between 580 and 750, are primarily from France, and have ages ranging from 22 to 47 years.\n\n## 5. Target Variable\nThe target variable is `Exited`, indicating whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0).\n\n## 6. Evaluation Metrics\nThe evaluation metric for the competition is the area under the ROC curve (AUC), which assesses the model's ability to distinguish between exited and non-exited customers.\n\n## 7. Submission Format\nThe submission file must include:\n- **Columns**: `id`, `Exited`\n- **Format**:\n```\nid,Exited\n165034,0.9\n165035,0.1\n165036,0.5\n```\n\n## 8. Other Key Aspects\n- The dataset is synthetically generated, allowing a balance between realism and integrity for the competition.\n- Participants are encouraged to explore feature relationships and apply various feature engineering techniques for better model performance.\n- The original bank customer churn dataset can be used for additional insights and feature comparisons.\n```\n</EXECUTION RESULT>\n\n"
