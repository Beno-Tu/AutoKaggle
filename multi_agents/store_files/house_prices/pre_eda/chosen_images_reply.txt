To select the most relevant images for the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis phase, I will focus on images that provide insights into the distribution and relationships of various features in the dataset. This will help in understanding the features better and preparing for the next phase of Data Cleaning.

Here are the selected images:

1. **bar_Neighborhood.png** - Understanding the distribution of houses across different neighborhoods.
2. **bar_MSZoning.png** - Insights into the zoning classifications of the properties.
3. **bar_LandContour.png** - Information about the contour of the land.
4. **bar_Condition1.png** - Insight into different conditions of the property.
5. **box_LotArea.png** - A box plot to visualize the distribution of lot areas.
6. **box_OverallQual.png** - A box plot to analyze the overall quality of houses.
7. **hist_YearBuilt.png** - A histogram to see the distribution of the year the houses were built.
8. **hist_LotFrontage.png** - A histogram to visualize the distribution of lot frontage.

Based on this reasoning, the response will be:
