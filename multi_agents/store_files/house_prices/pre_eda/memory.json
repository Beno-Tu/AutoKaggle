The features span across different categories including numerical, categorical, and identifiers. Key observations include:\n\n- **Identifiers**: Each house is uniquely identified by the feature `Id`.\n- **Numerical Features**: These features include measurements like `LotFrontage`, `LotArea`, and `GrLivArea`, as well as counts like `BedroomAbvGr` and `GarageCars`. These features are likely to be continuous variables.\n- **Categorical Features**: These features include categories such as `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Alley`, `LotShape`, etc. These represent non-numeric data that categorizes houses based on different attributes.\n- **Target Variable**: The target variable `SalePrice` represents the house prices and is only available in the training dataset.\n\nNotable patterns:\n- The `OverallQual` and `OverallCond` features likely represent overall quality and condition ratings on a scale.\n- `YearBuilt` and `YearRemodAdd` indicate the year the house was built and the year it was remodeled, respectively.\n- Features like `GarageType`, `GarageFinish`, `GarageQual`, and `GarageCond` provide detailed information about garages.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **SalePrice**: This is the target variable for the training dataset. It represents the sale price of the houses.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should include the following columns:\n- Id (integer): Unique identifier for each house.\n- SalePrice (float): Predicted sale price for each house.\n\nExample:\n```\nId,SalePrice\n1461,200000\n1462,181500\n1463,223500\n...\n```\n\nIn this phase, you have `train.csv` and `test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Perform initial data exploration on both datasets.\n2. Identify basic statistics, data types, and distributions.\n3. Detect potential issues like missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.\n4. Provide insights to guide the subsequent Data Cleaning phase.\n\n\n#############\n# NOTE #\n## PLANNING GUIDELINES ##\n1. Limit the plan to a MAXIMUM of FOUR tasks.\n2. Provide clear methods and constraints for each task.\n3. Focus on critical steps specific to the current phase.\n4. Prioritize methods and values mentioned in USER RULES.\n5. Offer detailed plans without writing actual code.\n6. ONLY focus on tasks relevant to this phase, avoiding those belonging to other phases. For example, during the in-depth EDA phase:\n    - you CAN perform detailed univariate analysis on KEY features.\n    - you CAN NOT modify any feature or modify data.\n\n## DATA OUTPUT PREFERENCES ##\n1. Prioritize TEXT format (print) for statistical information.\n2. Print a description before outputting statistics.\n3. Generate images only if text description is inadequate.\n\n## METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS ##\n1. Provide highly detailed methods, especially for data cleaning.\n2. Specify actions for each feature without omissions.\n\n## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ##\n1. Consider runtime and efficiency, particularly for:\n   - Data visualization\n   - Large dataset handling\n   - Complex algorithms\n2. Limit generated images to a MAXIMUM of 10 for EDA.\n3. Focus on critical visualizations with valuable insights.\n\n## OPTIMIZATION EXAMPLE ##\nWhen using seaborn or matplotlib for large datasets:\n- Turn off unnecessary details (e.g., annot=False in heatmaps)\n- Prioritize efficiency in plot generation\n\n#############\n# TASK #\n\nPlease design plan that is clear and specific to each FEATURE for the current development phase: Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis. \nThe developer will execute tasks based on your plan. \nI will provide you with INFORMATION, RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, and previous reports and plans.\nYou can use the following reasoning pattern to design the plan:\n1. Break down the task into smaller steps.\n2. For each step, ask yourself and answer:\n    - \"What is the objective of this step?\"\n    - \"What are the essential actions to achieve the objective?\"\n    - \"What features are involved in each action?\"\n    - \"Which tool can be used for each action? What are the parameters of the tool?\"\n    - \"What are the expected output of each action? What is the impact of the action on the data?\"\n    - \"What are the constraints of this step?\"\n\n\n#############\n# RESPONSE #\nLet's work this out in a step by step way.\n\n#############\n# START PLANNING #\nBefore you begin, please request the following documents from me, which contain important information that will guide your planning:\n1. Report and plan from the previous phase\n2. Available tools in this phase\n3. Sample data for analysis\n"

Data Loading:\n   - Always load data files from the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/` directory.\n   - Use specific files for each phase:\n     - Data Cleaning: `train.csv` and `test.csv`\n     - Feature Engineering: `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`\n     - Model Building, Validation, and Prediction: `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`\n\n2. Data Saving:\n   - Save image files in the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/pre_eda/images/` directory.\n   - Save data files in the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/` directory.\n   - Use clear, meaningful names for image files that reflect their content.\n   - Do NOT use special characters like `/` or spaces in file names.\n   - Save specific files for each phase:\n     - Data Cleaning: `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`\n     - Feature Engineering: `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`\n\n3. Data Processing:\n   - Always work on a copy of the DataFrame, not the original.\n   - Ensure correct data types for all columns before any operations.\n   - Apply consistent modifications (e.g., scaling, encoding) to both training and test sets.\n   - Take care with target-dependent operations on the test set, which lacks the target variable.\n   - Do NOT modify Id-type columns.\n\n## CODING PRACTICES ##\n1. General Rules:\n   - Use `print()` for outputting values.\n   - Avoid writing `assert` statements.\n\n2. Visualization:\n   - Use `plt.close()` after saving each image.\n   - Limit EDA visualizations to 10 or fewer, focusing on the most insightful.\n   - Optimize for large datasets (e.g., `annot=False` in seaborn heatmaps).\n\n3. Efficiency:\n   - Prioritize runtime efficiency, especially for:\n     - Data visualization\n     - Large dataset handling\n     - Complex algorithms\n\n## EXAMPLES ##\n- Before calculating a correlation matrix, ensure all data is numerical. Handle non-numerical data appropriately.\n- Verify consistent data types across columns before merging or joining operations.\n\nRemember: Always consider resource constraints and prioritize efficiency in your code.\n"

proportions.\n\n### STEP 3: Univariate Analysis of Numerical Features\n**Task:** Visualize distributions and identify outliers for numerical features.\n\n### STEP 4: Univariate Analysis of Categorical Features\n**Task:** Visualize frequency distributions for categorical features.\n\nLet's begin coding each step:\n\n### STEP 1: Data Structure and Summary\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Load the data using `pandas.read_csv`.\n- Inspect the data using `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()` methods.\n- Get summary statistics for categorical features using `describe(include=['O'])`.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load datasets\ntrain_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/train.csv'\ntest_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/test.csv'\n\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv(train_path)\ntest_df = pd.read_csv(test_path)\n\n# Inspect data\nprint(\"Train Data

(Categorical):\")\nprint(test_df.describe(include=['O']))\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The code loads the training and testing datasets.\n- Displays the first few rows, data types, and summary statistics for both numerical and categorical features.\n\n### STEP 2: Missing Values Analysis\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Calculate the count and percentage of missing values for each feature.\n\n```python\n# Calculate missing values for training data\nmissing_train = train_df.isnull().sum()\nmissing_train_percent = (missing_train / len(train_df)) * 100\nmissing_train_summary = pd.DataFrame({'Missing Values': missing_train, 'Percentage': missing_train_percent})\nmissing_train_summary = missing_train_summary[missing_train_summary['Missing Values'] > 0].sort_values(by='Percentage', ascending=False)\n\nprint(\"\\nMissing Values in Training Data:\")\nprint(missing_train_summary)\n\n# Calculate missing values for testing data\nmissing_test = test_df.isnull().sum()\nmissing_test_percent = (missing_test / len(test_df)) * 100\nmissing_test_summary = pd.DataFrame({'Missing Values': missing_test, 'Percentage': missing_test_percent})\nmissing_test_summary = missing_test_summary[missing_test_summary['Missing Values'] > 0].sort_values(by='Percentage', ascending=False)\n\nprint(\"\\nMissing Values in Testing Data:\")\nprint(missing_test_summary)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The code calculates the missing values and their percentages for both training and testing datasets.\n- Displays the features with missing values sorted by their percentage.\n\n### STEP 3: Univariate Analysis of Numerical Features\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Visualize the distribution of numerical features using histograms.\n- Identify outliers using box plots.\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Select numerical features for visualization\nnumerical_features = ['LotFrontage', 'LotArea', 'GrLivArea', 'SalePrice']\n\n# Histograms for numerical features\nfor feature in numerical_features:\n    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n    sns.histplot(train_df[feature].dropna(), kde=True)\n    plt.title(f'Distribution of {feature}')\n    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/pre_eda/images/hist_{feature}.png')\n    plt.close()\n\n# Box plots for numerical features\nfor feature in numerical_features:\n    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n    sns.boxplot(x=train_df[feature].dropna())\n    plt.title(f'Box Plot of {feature}')\n    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/pre_eda/images/box_{feature}.png')\n    plt.close()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The code generates histograms and box plots for selected numerical features.\n- Saves the visualizations in the specified directory.\n\n### STEP 4: Univariate Analysis of Categorical Features\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Visualize the frequency distribution of categorical features using bar plots.\n\n```python\n# Select categorical features for visualization\ncategorical_features = ['MSZoning', 'Street', 'Alley', 'LotShape', 'LandContour']\n\n# Bar plots for categorical features\nfor feature in categorical_features:\n    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n    sns.countplot(x=train_df[feature].dropna())\n

The features span across different categories including numerical, categorical, and identifiers. Key observations include:\n\n- **Identifiers**: Each house is uniquely identified by the feature `Id`.\n- **Numerical Features**: These features include measurements like `LotFrontage`, `LotArea`, and `GrLivArea`, as well as counts like `BedroomAbvGr` and `GarageCars`. These features are likely to be continuous variables.\n- **Categorical Features**: These features include categories such as `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Alley`, `LotShape`, etc. These represent non-numeric data that categorizes houses based on different attributes.\n- **Target Variable**: The target variable `SalePrice` represents the house prices and is only available in the training dataset.\n\nNotable patterns:\n- The `OverallQual` and `OverallCond` features likely represent overall quality and condition ratings on a scale.\n- `YearBuilt` and `YearRemodAdd` indicate the year the house was built and the year it was remodeled, respectively.\n- Features like `GarageType`, `GarageFinish`, `GarageQual`, and `GarageCond` provide detailed information about garages.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **SalePrice**: This is the target variable for the training dataset. It represents the sale price of the houses.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should include the following columns:\n- Id (integer): Unique identifier for each house.\n- SalePrice (float): Predicted sale price for each house.\n\nExample:\n```\nId,SalePrice\n1461,200000\n1462,181500\n1463,223500\n...\n```\nIn this phase, you have `train.csv` and `test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Perform initial data exploration on both datasets.\n2. Identify basic statistics, data types, and distributions.\n3. Detect potential issues like missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.\n4.

Here\u2019s a detailed description of the data represented in the chart:\n\n**X-axis (MSZoning Categories):**\n- RL\n- RM\n- C (all)\n- FV\n- RH\n\n**Y-axis (Count):**\n- The count ranges from 0 to 1200.\n\n**Data Distribution:**\n- **RL (Residential Low Density):** This category has the highest count, slightly below 1200.\n- **RM (Residential Medium Density):** This category has the second-highest count, which is around 200.\n- **C (all) (Commercial):** This category has the lowest count, close to 0 but slightly above it.\n- **FV (Floating Village Residential):** This category has a count of just above 100.\n- **RH (Residential High Density):** This category has a count close to 0, slightly above it.\n\n**Insights:**\n1. **Dominance of RL Zoning:** The RL zoning category is overwhelmingly dominant, indicating that the majority of the properties in this dataset are classified as Residential Low Density. This could imply that the area under study is primarily suburban or low-density residential.\n   \n2. **Low Presence of Commercial and High-Density Residential Zones:** Both C (all) and RH zoning categories have very low counts, suggesting that commercial and high-density residential areas are quite limited in this dataset. This might reflect a community with few commercial developments and high-density housing options.\n   \n3. **Moderate Presence of RM and FV Zoning:** RM and FV categories have moderate counts, with RM being significantly more common than FV. This shows there is a presence of medium-density residential and some unique floating village residential zones, but they are not as prevalent as low-density residential zones.\n\nThese insights can help urban planners, real estate developers, and policymakers understand the zoning distribution and potentially guide future development or zoning changes to balance residential density and commercial space.\n## IMAGE: bar_LandContour.png ##\nThe image is a bar chart displaying the frequency distribution of the \"LandContour\" variable. Here is a detailed description of the chart:\n\n1. **Title**: The chart is titled \"Frequency Distribution of LandContour\".\n2. **Axes**:\n   - The x-axis represents the \"LandContour\" categories.\n   - The y-axis represents the \"count\" of occurrences for each category.\n\n3. **Categories**: There are four categories of \"LandContour\" represented on the x-axis:\n   - Lvl (Level)\n   - Bnk (Bank)\n   - Low (Low)\n   - HLS (Hills)\n\n4. **Distribution**:\n   - **Lvl**: This category has the highest count, with approximately 1250 occurrences.\n   - **Bnk**: This category has a very low count, around 50 occurrences.\n   - **Low**: This category also has a low count, similar to \"Bnk\", around 50 occurrences.\n   - **HLS**: This category has a slightly higher count than \"Bnk\" and \"Low\", but still significantly lower than \"Lvl\", with around 75 occurrences.\n\n5. **Insights**:\n   - The \"Lvl\" category is overwhelmingly the most common land contour, indicating that level land is far more prevalent in the dataset compared to other land contours.\n   - The other three categories (\"Bnk\", \"Low\", and \"HLS\") are significantly less frequent, each with counts below 100.\n   - The distribution is highly skewed towards the \"Lvl\" category, suggesting that the majority of the land in this dataset is level.\n\nUnderstanding the distribution of land contour can be useful for various analyses, such as real estate valuation, urban planning, or environmental studies. The predominance of level land might influence factors like construction difficulty, cost, and suitability for different types of development.\n## IMAGE: bar_Condition1.png ##\nThe image is a bar chart titled \"Frequency Distribution of Condition1.\" It represents the count of different categories within the variable \"Condition1.\" \n\nHere is a detailed description of the data shown:\n\n1. **Categories and Their Counts:**\n   - \"Norm\" has the highest frequency, with a count of slightly over 1,200.\n   - \"Feedr\" has the second highest frequency, with a count around 200.\n   - \"PosN,\" \"Artery,\" \"RRAe,\" \"RRNn,\" \"RRAn,\" \"PosA,\" and \"RRNe\" have significantly lower frequencies, each with counts less than 100.\n\n2. **Distribution:**\n   - The distribution is highly skewed towards the \"Norm\" category, which dominates the dataset.\n   - Other categories have relatively low and comparable frequencies.\n\n3. **Insights:**\n   - The vast majority of observations fall under the \"Norm\" category, indicating that this condition is the most common by a significant margin.\n   - The \"Feedr\" category is the second most frequent but is still much less common than \"Norm.\"\n   - The remaining categories are rare in comparison, suggesting they are less typical conditions in the dataset.\n\n4. **Potential Implications:**\n   - When analyzing data involving \"Condition1,\" it's crucial to recognize that the majority of data points will be under the \"Norm\" category, which could heavily influence any statistical analysis or modeling.\n   - The infrequency of categories other than \"Norm\" might pose challenges for certain types of analysis, such as predictive modeling, due to the imbalance in the dataset.\n   - If this data represents conditions in a real-world scenario (e.g., types of roads, medical conditions, etc.), it might indicate that the \"Norm\" condition is the standard or baseline state, and the other conditions are exceptions or special cases.\n\nOverall, this distribution suggests a strong imbalance towards one category, which should be considered in any further analysis or interpretation of the data involving \"Condition1.\"\n## IMAGE: box_LotArea.png ##\nThe image is a box plot representing the distribution of 'LotArea'. Here is a detailed description and analysis of the plot:\n\n### Description of the Box Plot:\n- **Title**: The title of the plot is \"Box Plot of LotArea\".\n- **Axes**:\n  - The x-axis is labeled \"LotArea\" and represents the variable being analyzed.\n  - The y-axis doesn't have a label or specific values indicated, as it is a box plot focusing on the distribution of LotArea.\n- **Box**:\n  - The box represents the interquartile range (IQR), which contains the middle 50% of the data points.\n  - The bottom and top of the box are the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) respectively.\n  - The line inside the box represents the median (Q2) of the LotArea.\n- **Whiskers**:\n  - The whiskers extend from the box and represent the range within 1.5 times the IQR from the first and third quartiles.\n- **Outliers**:\n  - Data points that fall outside of the whiskers are considered outliers and are plotted as individual points.\n  - There are a significant number of outliers on the right side, indicating large LotArea values.\n\n### Distribution Analysis:\n- **Central Tendency**:\n  - The median (Q2) line is situated closer to the lower end of the box, suggesting a right-skewed distribution.\n- **Spread**:\n  - The IQR (height of the box) shows a relatively small spread of the middle 50% of the LotArea values.\n- **Outliers**:\n  - There are many outliers present on the high end (right side) of the LotArea distribution, indicating that there are several properties with significantly larger lot areas compared to the majority.\n  - The most extreme outlier appears to be around 200,000 square units.\n\n### Insights:\n1. **Skewness**: The distribution of LotArea is right-skewed, meaning most properties have smaller lot areas, but a few properties have very large lot areas.\n2. **Outliers**: The presence of numerous outliers suggests that there are exceptional cases with very large lot areas which could affect the mean and other statistical analyses if not handled properly.\n3. **Variability**: The IQR shows that the majority of the properties have lot areas within a relatively small range, but the presence of extreme outliers indicates high variability in the dataset.\n4. **Data Cleaning**: Depending on the analysis goals, it might be beneficial to investigate the outliers further to understand if they are genuine data points or errors, and decide whether to include or exclude them in further analysis.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Further Analysis of Outliers**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the properties with very large lot areas to understand the context behind these values.\n- **Handling Skewness**: Consider transformations (e.g., log transformation) to handle the skewness if applying statistical models that assume normality.\n- **Segmentation**: Segmenting the data into different ranges of LotArea might provide more insights into different property types and their characteristics.\n\nThis box plot provides a clear visualization of the distribution and highlights areas for further investigation and potential data preprocessing steps.\n\n\n#############\n# REVIEW #\n{'final_suggestion': {'agent developer': '1.

Which files were generated? Answer with detailed file path.\n### Answer 1\n- **Processed Files:**\n  - Training Data: `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/train.csv`\n  - Testing Data: `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/test.csv`\n  \n- **Generated Files:**\n  - Histograms for numerical features saved as:\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/pre_eda/images/hist_[feature].png` (for features like LotFrontage, LotArea, etc.)\n  - Box plots for numerical features saved as:\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/pre_eda/images/box_[feature].png` (for features like LotFrontage, LotArea, etc.)\n  - Bar plots for categorical features saved as:\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/pre_eda/images/bar_[feature].png` (for features like Neighborhood, MSZoning, etc.)\n\n### Question 2\nWhich features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations.\n### Answer 2\n- **Involved Features:**\n  - **Numerical Features:** LotFrontage, LotArea, OverallQual, OverallCond, YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd, MasVnrArea, etc.\n  - **Categorical Features:** MSZoning, Street, Alley, LotShape, LandContour, Utilities, Neighborhood, etc.\n\n- **Changes:**\n  - No features were deleted or created in this phase.\n  - Feature types remained the same (numerical and categorical) without modifications.\n\n### Question 3\nWhat insights were gained regarding the structure and types of data in the datasets?\n### Answer 3\n- The dataset comprises 81 columns in training data and 80 in testing data.\n- Features are divided into identifiers, numerical, and categorical.\n- Notable characteristics include:\n  - **Numerical Features:** Continuous variables (e.g., LotArea, GrLivArea) and count variables (e.g., BedroomAbvGr).\n  - **Categorical Features:** Various categories such as MSZoning and Neighborhood, indicating demographic or zoning classifications.\n- The structure suggests a mixture of residential and possibly commercial real estate data.\n\n### Question 4\nWhich features were found to have missing values, and what is the extent (count and percentage) of these missing values?\n### Answer 4\n- **Missing Values in Training Data:**\n  - Example: \n    - LotFrontage: 330 missing (22.6%)\n    - Alley: 1369 missing (93.8%)\n    - PoolQC: 1453 missing (99.5%)\n  \n- **Missing Values in Testing Data:**\n  - Example:\n    - LotFrontage: 172 missing (22.8%)\n    - Alley: 1352 missing (97.4%)\n    - PoolQC: 1433 missing (99.5%)\n\n### Question 5\nWhat outliers were detected in the numerical features, and which features are primarily affected by these outliers?\n### Answer 5\n- **Detected Outliers:**\n  - Features such as LotArea displayed a significant number of outliers, particularly on the higher end.\n  - The box plot analysis indicated extreme values above the usual range, suggesting a few properties with exceptionally large lot areas.\n- Other numerical features may also exhibit outliers, but specific details are primarily highlighted for LotArea.\n\n### Question 6\nBased on the findings from this phase, what specific cleaning tasks should be prioritized to prepare the data for the next phases of the competition?\n### Answer 6\n- **Prioritize Cleaning Tasks:**\n  - Address missing values: Implement strategies for imputation or removal based on the percentage of missingness.\n  - Investigate outliers: Determine if outliers are valid data points or errors. Consider transformations or removal for skewed distributions.\n  - Categorical feature imbalances: Analyze categorical features with low frequencies to see if they should be merged with other categories.\n  - Prepare for feature engineering: Identify potential features for creation based on insights, especially from categorical variables."
