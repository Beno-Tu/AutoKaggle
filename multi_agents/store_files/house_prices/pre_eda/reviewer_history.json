The features span across different categories including numerical, categorical, and identifiers. Key observations include:\n\n- **Identifiers**: Each house is uniquely identified by the feature `Id`.\n- **Numerical Features**: These features include measurements like `LotFrontage`, `LotArea`, and `GrLivArea`, as well as counts like `BedroomAbvGr` and `GarageCars`. These features are likely to be continuous variables.\n- **Categorical Features**: These features include categories such as `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Alley`, `LotShape`, etc. These represent non-numeric data that categorizes houses based on different attributes.\n- **Target Variable**: The target variable `SalePrice` represents the house prices and is only available in the training dataset.\n\nNotable patterns:\n- The `OverallQual` and `OverallCond` features likely represent overall quality and condition ratings on a scale.\n- `YearBuilt` and `YearRemodAdd` indicate the year the house was built and the year it was remodeled, respectively.\n- Features like `GarageType`, `GarageFinish`, `GarageQual`, and `GarageCond` provide detailed information about garages.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **SalePrice**: This is the target variable for the training dataset. It represents the sale price of the houses.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should include the following columns:\n- Id (integer): Unique identifier for each house.\n- SalePrice (float): Predicted sale price for each house.\n\nExample:\n```\nId,SalePrice\n1461,200000\n1462,181500\n1463,223500\n...\n```\n    </background_info>\n   <plan>\n## PLAN\n\n### STEP 1\n**Task:** Data Structure and Summary\n- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**\n  - Load datasets using `pandas.read_csv`\n  - Inspect data with `df.head()`, `df.info()`, and `df.describe()`\n  - Use `df.describe(include=['O'])` for categorical features\n- **Expected output or Impact on data:**\n  - Basic understanding of data structure\n  - Summary statistics including mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles for numerical features\n  - Frequency counts for categorical features\n- **Constraints:**\n  - Analyze both training and testing datasets separately\n\n### STEP 2\n**Task:** Missing Values Analysis\n- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**\n  - Calculate missing values using `df.isnull().sum()`\n  - Calculate percentage of missing values relative to total rows\n- **Expected output or Impact on data:**\n  - List of features with missing values and their corresponding count and percentage of missingness\n- **Constraints:**\n  - Focus on both training and testing datasets\n\n### STEP 3\n**Task:** Univariate Analysis of Numerical Features\n- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**\n  - Visualize distributions with histograms using `sns.histplot` or `plt.hist`\n  - Identify outliers with box plots using `sns.boxplot`\n- **Expected output or Impact on data:**\n  - Histograms and box plots for numerical features with insights into their distributions and any potential outliers\n- **Constraints:**\n  - Limit the number of generated images to a maximum of 10 critical visualizations\n  - Prioritize features likely to influence the target variable `SalePrice`\n\n### STEP 4\n**Task:** Univariate Analysis of Categorical Features\n- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**\n  - Visualize frequency distributions with bar plots using `sns.countplot`\n- **Expected output or Impact on data:**\n  - Bar plots for categorical features showing the frequency distribution of categories\n- **Constraints:**\n  - Limit the number of generated images to a maximum of 10 critical visualizations\n  - Highlight any categorical features with imbalances or unusual patterns\n    </plan>\n</INPUT>\n<EXECUTION RESULT>\nGreat!
