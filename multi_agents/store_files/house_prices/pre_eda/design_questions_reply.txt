Based on the provided INFO and PLAN for the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis phase, here are six key questions designed to summarize the findings and guide the transition to the Data Cleaning phase:

### Key Questions

1. **What insights were gained regarding the structure and types of data in the datasets?**
   - *Purpose:* This question aims to summarize the overall data structure, including the number of records, types of features, and distributions, which will inform how to approach data cleaning.

2. **Which features were found to have missing values, and what is the extent (count and percentage) of these missing values?**
   - *Purpose:* Identifying features with missing values is crucial for planning how to handle them in the cleaning phase, whether through imputation, deletion, or other methods.

3. **What outliers were detected in the numerical features, and which features are primarily affected by these outliers?**
   - *Purpose:* Understanding the presence of outliers helps determine whether they should be removed, capped, or further investigated, guiding the cleaning strategy.

4. **Which categorical features exhibited imbalances or unusual patterns, and what implications might these have for data cleaning?**
   - *Purpose:* This question focuses on identifying categorical features that may require special handling, such as encoding or re-sampling, to prepare them for modeling.

5. **What preliminary statistical summaries or visualizations indicated potential issues or areas of concern in the data?**
   - *Purpose:* Highlighting specific statistics or visual patterns that signal data quality issues (e.g., extreme values, skewed distributions) can guide targeted cleaning efforts.

6. **Based on the findings from this phase, what specific cleaning tasks should be prioritized to prepare the data for the next phases of the competition?**
   - *Purpose:* This reflective question encourages forward-thinking, enabling the planner to outline a clear action plan for the data cleaning phase based on insights gained during the preliminary analysis.

These questions are designed to ensure that the key findings from the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis phase are effectively summarized, while also providing a roadmap for the necessary data cleaning actions.
