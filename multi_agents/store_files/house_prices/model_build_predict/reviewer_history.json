These features are categorized into numerical and categorical types. The numerical features include dimensions, quality ratings, and counts of various attributes of the properties. Meanwhile, the categorical features describe the characteristics of the properties, such as their shape, configuration, and quality ratings.\n\nNotable patterns include:\n- The presence of different quality and condition ratings for both the exterior and the basement.\n- Various types of configurations for the lot and garage.\n- Multiple neighborhood indicators.\n- Different types of roof materials and styles.\n- Multiple indicators for heating and electrical systems.\n\nThe data also includes derived features such as:\n- HouseAge\n- YearsSinceRemod\n- TotalBath\n- TotalPorchSF\n- TotalSF\n- OverallQual_SF\n\n## Target Variable\nThe target variable is 'SalePrice', which represents the sale price of the houses. This variable is used to train models to predict house prices based on the given features.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file format includes the following columns:\n- Id: Unique identifier for each property (integer)\n- SalePrice: Predicted sale price of the property (float)\n    </background_info>\n   <plan>\n## PLAN\n\n### STEP 1\nTask: Data Preparation\n- **Separate Target Variable (`SalePrice`) from Training Data:**\n  - Extract the `SalePrice` column from `processed_train.csv` and store it as `y_train`.\n  - Remove the `SalePrice` column from the training dataset.\n- **Remove Non-Numeric Columns:**\n  - Identify and remove columns that are non-numeric from both the training and test datasets.\n  - Ensure the same columns are removed from both datasets to maintain consistency.\n- **Ensure Consistent Features Across Train and Test Sets:**\n  - Verify that both the training and test datasets have the same features after removing non-numeric columns and the target variable.\n\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Pandas:** For data manipulation (`drop`, `select_dtypes`)\n- **Numpy:** For handling numerical operations\n- **Features:** `SalePrice`, non-numeric columns identified using `select_dtypes`\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- `X_train`: Training dataset with numeric features only\n- `y_train`: Target variable for the training dataset\n- `X_test`: Test dataset with numeric features only\n\nConstraints: Ensure no data leakage by maintaining the same preprocessing steps on both datasets.\n\n### STEP 2\nTask: Model Selection\n- **Choose Three Models for Training:**\n  - Select three models to train and compare.
