Let's work through the problem step-by-step to identify and correct the issue in the code snippet.

### Step 1: Analyze the Issue
The test case indicates that the mean of the first 100 values in the `submission.csv` file is outside the expected range. The actual values in `submission.csv` appear to be significantly lower than the expected values. This suggests that there might be an issue with the predicted values of `SalePrice`.

### Step 2: Identify the Problem
From the output messages, it seems that the predictions are very close to each other and quite small, which is unusual for house prices. The problem could be related to a transformation applied to the target variable (`SalePrice`) that was not reversed before saving the submission file.

### Step 3: Correct the Code Snippet
To correct the issue, we need to ensure that any transformation applied to the target variable during training is reversed before saving the predictions. A common transformation for target variables in regression problems is the logarithm. If the `SalePrice` was transformed using a logarithm (e.g., `log(SalePrice)`), we need to exponentiate the predictions to revert them back to the original scale.

### Step 4: Apply the Correction
Let's assume that the `SalePrice` was transformed using a natural logarithm (base `e`). We can use the `np.exp` function to reverse this transformation.

Here is the corrected code snippet:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Fit the best model on the entire training set
best_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = best_model.predict(X_test)

# Reverse the log transformation
predictions = np.exp(predictions)

# Prepare the submission file
submission = pd.DataFrame({
    'Id': test_df['Id'],
    'SalePrice': predictions
})

# Save the submission file
submission_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/submission.csv'
submission.to_csv(submission_path, index=False)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing Required Libraries**: Make sure that `numpy` and `pandas` are imported.
2. **Fitting the Model**: The model is trained on the entire training set.
3. **Making Predictions**: Predictions are made on the test set.
4. **Reversing the Transformation**: The predictions are exponentiated using `np.exp()` to reverse the logarithmic transformation.
5. **Preparing the Submission File**: The `Id` column from `test_df` is combined with the predictions to create the submission DataFrame.
6. **Saving the Submission File**: The submission DataFrame is saved to the specified path.

By making sure the transformation is reversed, the predicted `SalePrice` values should now be in the correct range, and the submission file should pass the test case.
