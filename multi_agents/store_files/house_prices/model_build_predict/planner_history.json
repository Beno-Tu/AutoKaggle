These features are categorized into numerical and categorical types. The numerical features include dimensions, quality ratings, and counts of various attributes of the properties. Meanwhile, the categorical features describe the characteristics of the properties, such as their shape, configuration, and quality ratings.\n\nNotable patterns include:\n- The presence of different quality and condition ratings for both the exterior and the basement.\n- Various types of configurations for the lot and garage.\n- Multiple neighborhood indicators.\n- Different types of roof materials and styles.\n- Multiple indicators for heating and electrical systems.\n\nThe data also includes derived features such as:\n- HouseAge\n- YearsSinceRemod\n- TotalBath\n- TotalPorchSF\n- TotalSF\n- OverallQual_SF\n\n## Target Variable\nThe target variable is 'SalePrice', which represents the sale price of the houses. This variable is used to train models to predict house prices based on the given features.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file format includes the following columns:\n- Id: Unique identifier for each property (integer)\n- SalePrice: Predicted sale price of the property (float)\n\nIn this phase, you have `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`. You should first train a model on the training set and then make predictions on the test set.\nBefore training the model:\n1. For the training set, separate the target column as y.\n2. Remove the target column and any non-numeric columns (e.g., String-type columns) that cannot be used in model training from the training set.\nBefore making predictions:\n1. For the test set, remove the same columns that were removed from the training set (except the target column, which is not present in the test set).\n2. Ensure consistency between the columns used in training and prediction.\nDue to computational resource limitations, you are allowed to train a maximum of **three** models\n\n#############\n# NOTE #\n## PLANNING GUIDELINES ##\n1. Limit the plan to a MAXIMUM of FOUR tasks.\n2. Provide clear methods and constraints for each task.\n3. Focus on critical steps specific to the current phase.\n4. Prioritize methods and values mentioned in USER RULES.\n5. Offer detailed plans without writing actual code.\n6. ONLY focus on tasks relevant to this phase, avoiding those belonging to other phases. For example, during the in-depth EDA phase:\n    - you CAN perform detailed univariate analysis on KEY features.\n    - you CAN NOT modify any feature or modify data.\n\n## DATA OUTPUT PREFERENCES ##\n1. Prioritize TEXT format (print) for statistical information.\n2. Print a description before outputting statistics.\n3. Generate images only if text description is inadequate.\n\n## METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS ##\n1. Provide highly detailed methods, especially for data cleaning.\n2. Specify actions for each feature without omissions.\n\n## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ##\n1. Consider runtime and efficiency, particularly for:\n   - Data visualization\n   - Large dataset handling\n   - Complex algorithms\n2. Limit generated images to a MAXIMUM of 10 for EDA.\n3. Focus on critical visualizations with valuable insights.\n\n## OPTIMIZATION EXAMPLE ##\nWhen using seaborn or matplotlib for large datasets:\n- Turn off unnecessary details (e.g., annot=False in heatmaps)\n- Prioritize efficiency in plot generation\n\n#############\n# TASK #\n\nPlease design plan that is clear and specific to each FEATURE for the current development phase: Model Building, Validation, and Prediction. \nThe developer will execute tasks based on your plan. \nI will provide you with INFORMATION, RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, and previous reports and plans.\nYou can use the following reasoning pattern to design the plan:\n1. Break down the task into smaller steps.\n2. For each step, ask yourself and answer:\n    - \"What is the objective of this step?\"\n    - \"What are the essential actions to achieve the objective?\"\n    - \"What features are involved in each action?\"\n    - \"Which tool can be used for each action? What are the parameters of the tool?\"\n    - \"What are the expected output of each action? What is the impact of the action on the data?\"\n    - \"What are the constraints of this step?\"\n\n\n#############\n# RESPONSE #\nLet's work this out in a step by step way.\n\n#############\n# START PLANNING #\nBefore you begin, please request the following documents from me, which contain important information that will guide your planning:\n1. Report and plan from the previous phase\n2. Available tools in this phase\n3. Sample data for analysis\n"

Which files were generated? Answer with detailed file path.\n### Answer 1\n- **Processed Files:**\n  - Input Files:\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train.csv`\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test.csv`\n  - Output Files:\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/processed_train.csv`\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/processed_test.csv`\n\n### Question 2\nWhich features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations. (This is a FIXED question for each phase.)\n### Answer 2\n- **New Features Created:**\n  - `HouseAge`: Calculated as `YrSold - YearBuilt`\n  - `YearsSinceRemod`: Calculated as `YrSold - YearRemodAdd`\n  - `TotalBath`: Combined total of different bath counts\n  - `TotalPorchSF`: Sum of different porch areas\n  - `TotalSF`: Sum of different floor areas\n  - `OverallQual_SF`: Interaction term between `OverallQual` and `GrLivArea`\n\n- **Transformed Features:**\n  - `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `SalePrice`: Log transformation applied to reduce skewness.\n\n- **Categorical Features Handled:**\n  - **Label Encoded:** `ExterQual`, `ExterCond`, `BsmtQual`, `BsmtCond`, `HeatingQC`, `KitchenQual`, `GarageQual`, `GarageCond`, `PoolQC`, `Fence`.\n  - **One-Hot Encoded:** `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Alley`, `Neighborhood`, `HouseStyle`, `RoofStyle`, `Condition1`, `Condition2`, `BldgType`.\n\n- **Deleted Features:** None noted in this phase.\n- **Modified Feature Types:** No feature types were modified; however, categorical features were transformed into numerical representations.\n\n### Question 3\nWhat new features were created during this phase, and how do they relate to existing features?\n### Answer 3\n- **New Features Created:**\n  - `HouseAge` and `YearsSinceRemod` provide insights into property age and renovations, which can significantly affect the sale price.\n  - `TotalBath` aggregates various bathroom counts into a single metric for simplification.\n  - `TotalPorchSF` and `TotalSF` summarize different areas of the house, emphasizing overall space.\n  - `OverallQual_SF` combines quality and livable area, aiming to capture interactions that affect pricing.\n\n### Question 4\nWhich existing features were transformed, and what impact did these transformations have on their distributions?\n### Answer 4\n- **Transformed Features:**\n  - `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, and `SalePrice` underwent log transformation using `np.log1p()`.\n  \n- **Impact on Distributions:**\n  - The log transformation generally reduces skewness, making distributions more normal. This is beneficial for linear models and improves interpretability of feature effects.\n\n### Question 5\nHow were categorical variables handled, and what encoding methods were applied? Were there any challenges faced in this process?\n### Answer 5\n- **Encoding Methods Applied:**\n  - **Label Encoding:** For ordinal categorical variables where the order matters.\n  - **One-Hot Encoding:** For nominal categorical variables to avoid ordinal assumptions.\n\n- **Challenges Faced:**\n  - Ensuring no excessive dimensionality from one-hot encoding. Columns were aligned between train and test datasets, maintaining consistency.\n  - Grouping rare categories might be necessary to reduce complexity, but this was not explicitly noted in the process.\n\n### Question 6\nBased on the findings from this phase, what key features should be prioritized for inclusion in the modeling phase, and why?\n### Answer 6\n- **Key Features to Prioritize:**\n  - `OverallQual_SF`: Strong interaction between quality and area.\n  - `TotalSF`: Represents the total livable space, likely correlating with price.\n  - `HouseAge` and `YearsSinceRemod`: Important for understanding depreciation and renovations.\n  - Log-transformed features (`LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `SalePrice`) to improve model performance by stabilizing variance.\n\n- **Rationale:**\n  - These features are expected to have high predictive power based on their relationships with `SalePrice` and their ability to capture significant variations in housing prices.\n\n#############\n# TARGET VARIABLE #\n['SalePrice']\n#############\n# PROCESSED TRAIN DATA WITH FEATURES
