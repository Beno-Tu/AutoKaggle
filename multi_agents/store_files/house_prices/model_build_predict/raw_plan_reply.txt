Thank you for providing all the necessary details. Based on the information and tools available, here is a comprehensive and specific plan for the "Model Building, Validation, and Prediction" phase:

### Task 1: Data Preparation

#### Objective:
Prepare the training and test datasets by ensuring consistency and removing irrelevant features.

#### Essential Actions:
1. **Separate Target Variable (`SalePrice`) from Training Data:**
   - Extract the `SalePrice` column from `processed_train.csv` and store it as `y_train`.
   - Remove the `SalePrice` column from the training dataset.

2. **Remove Non-Numeric Columns:**
   - Identify and remove columns that are non-numeric from both the training and test datasets.
   - Ensure the same columns are removed from both datasets to maintain consistency.

3. **Ensure Consistent Features Across Train and Test Sets:**
   - Verify that both the training and test datasets have the same features after removing non-numeric columns and the target variable.

#### Steps:
1. **Extract and Remove Target Variable:**
   - Load `processed_train.csv` into a DataFrame `train_df`.
   - Extract `SalePrice` into `y_train` and remove it from `train_df`.

2. **Identify and Remove Non-Numeric Columns:**
   - Use `train_df.select_dtypes(exclude=[np.number]).columns` to identify non-numeric columns.
   - Remove these columns from both `train_df` and `processed_test.csv`.

3. **Ensure Consistency:**
   - Ensure `train_df` and `processed_test.csv` have the same columns by cross-checking and aligning.

#### Tools and Parameters:
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation (`drop`, `select_dtypes`)
- **Numpy:** For handling numerical operations

#### Expected Output:
- `X_train`: Training dataset with numeric features only
- `y_train`: Target variable for the training dataset
- `X_test`: Test dataset with numeric features only

#### Constraints:
- Ensure no data leakage by maintaining the same preprocessing steps on both datasets.

### Task 2: Model Selection

#### Objective:
Select appropriate models for training based on the nature of the data and constraints.

#### Essential Actions:
1. **Choose Three Models for Training:**
   - Select three models to train and compare. Common choices for regression problems include:
     1. Linear Regression
     2. Random Forest Regressor
     3. Gradient Boosting Regressor

#### Steps:
1. **Select Models:**
   - Based on the problem type (regression) and available models, choose Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor.

#### Tools and Parameters:
- **Scikit-learn:** For model selection (`LinearRegression`, `RandomForestRegressor`, `GradientBoostingRegressor`)

#### Expected Output:
- Selected models for training

#### Constraints:
- Limit to three models due to computational resource constraints.

### Task 3: Model Training and Validation

#### Objective:
Train the selected models on the training dataset and validate their performance using cross-validation.

#### Essential Actions:
1. **Train Models:**
   - Train each of the three selected models on the `X_train` and `y_train` datasets.

2. **Validate Models:**
   - Use cross-validation (e.g., K-Fold cross-validation) to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.
   - Calculate performance metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) since the evaluation metric is based on RMSE.

#### Steps:
1. **Train Models:**
   - Use the `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` tool.
   - Input: `X_train`, `y_train`, `problem_type='regression'`, `selected_models=['linear regression', 'random forest', 'XGBoost']`

2. **Validate Models:**
   - Perform cross-validation within the tool to obtain RMSE for each model.

#### Tools and Parameters:
- **Scikit-learn:** For training and validation (`cross_val_score`, `KFold`)
- **train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model:** For automated training and validation

#### Expected Output:
- Cross-validation scores for each model
- Performance comparison of the models
- Best performing model

#### Constraints:
- Efficiently manage runtime and computational resources during cross-validation.

### Task 4: Prediction and Submission Preparation

#### Objective:
Make predictions on the test dataset and prepare the submission file in the required format.

#### Essential Actions:
1. **Make Predictions:**
   - Use the best-performing model from the validation phase to make predictions on the `X_test` dataset.

2. **Prepare Submission File:**
   - Create a DataFrame with columns `Id` and `SalePrice`.
   - Populate the `SalePrice` column with the predicted values.
   - Ensure the `Id` column matches the `Id` column from the test dataset.

#### Steps:
1. **Make Predictions:**
   - Utilize the best-performing model obtained from `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model`.
   - Predict `SalePrice` using `X_test`.

2. **Prepare Submission File:**
   - Create a DataFrame with `Id` from `processed_test.csv` and `SalePrice` from predictions.
   - Save the DataFrame to a CSV file in the required submission format.

#### Tools and Parameters:
- **Pandas:** For DataFrame manipulation and CSV file generation (`to_csv`)

#### Expected Output:
- CSV file ready for submission with columns `Id` and `SalePrice`

#### Constraints:
- Ensure the submission file adheres to the required format.

### Summary of Steps:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Separate `SalePrice` from training data.
   - Remove non-numeric columns.
   - Ensure consistent features across train and test sets.

2. **Model Selection:**
   - Select Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor for training.

3. **Model Training and Validation:**
