## CODE SNIPPET 1 WITH PROBLEM ##
```python
# Fit the best model on the entire training set
best_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = best_model.predict(X_test)

# Prepare the submission file
submission = pd.DataFrame({
    'Id': test_df['Id'],
    'SalePrice': predictions
})

# Save the submission file
submission_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/submission.csv'
submission.to_csv(submission_path, index=False)
