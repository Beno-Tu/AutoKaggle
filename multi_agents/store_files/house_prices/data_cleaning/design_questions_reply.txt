Based on the provided information and plan for the Data Cleaning phase, here are six key questions designed to summarize the findings and guide the transition to the In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis phase:

### Key Questions

1. **What specific missing values were addressed, and what imputation methods were used for each feature?**
   - **Purpose:** To summarize how missing data was treated, which is critical for understanding the quality of the datasets moving forward.

2. **Which outliers were detected, and what actions were taken to handle them?**
   - **Purpose:** To provide insights on the impact of outliers on the data and how they were managed, which will influence the analysis of trends and relationships in the next phase.

3. **What discrepancies or inconsistencies were found between the training and test datasets, and how were they resolved?**
   - **Purpose:** To ensure that any inconsistencies have been addressed, as they can greatly affect the validity of exploratory analyses and model predictions.

4. **Were any features removed or created during the data cleaning process? If so, what were the reasons for these changes?**
   - **Purpose:** To clarify the dataset's structure, helping to focus the exploratory analysis on relevant features.

5. **What transformations were applied to the data types of any features, and how do they align with the intended analysis for the next phase?**
   - **Purpose:** To ensure that all features are in the correct format for analysis, guiding decisions on statistical methods and visualizations.

6. **What are the key findings or patterns observed during the data cleaning process that should be further investigated in the exploratory analysis?**
   - **Purpose:** To identify areas of interest or concern that could influence the exploratory analysis, leading to more informed and targeted investigations.

These questions aim to encapsulate the key findings of the Data Cleaning phase while providing a clear pathway for the In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis phase.
