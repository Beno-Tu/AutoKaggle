Sure, let's break down the problem step by step and correct the error code snippet.

### Step 1: Analyze the Error

The error message indicates that the `convert_data_types` function raises a `ValueError` because the column `'FireplaceQu'` is not found in the DataFrame. This suggests that `categorical_columns` includes the column `'FireplaceQu'`, which does not exist in `test_df`.

### Step 2: Think About the Solution

There are several potential solutions to this problem:
1. **Check for Missing Columns:** Before calling `convert_data_types`, ensure that all columns listed in `categorical_columns` exist in `test_df`.
2. **Remove Missing Columns:** Remove any columns from `categorical_columns` that are not present in `test_df`.

### Step 3: Implement the Solution

We'll implement a solution that removes any missing columns from `categorical_columns` before calling `convert_data_types`.

Hereâ€™s the corrected code snippet:

```python
# Ensure categorical_columns only contains columns present in test_df
categorical_columns = [col for col in categorical_columns if col in test_df.columns]

# Now call the convert_data_types function with the cleaned list
test_df = convert_data_types(test_df, categorical_columns, target_type='str')
```

By filtering `categorical_columns` to include only those columns that are actually present in `test_df`, we avoid the error caused by missing columns.

### Step 4: Output the Corrected Code Snippet

Here is the final corrected code snippet:

```python
# Ensure categorical_columns only contains columns present in test_df
categorical_columns = [col for col in categorical_columns if col in test_df.columns]

# Now call the convert_data_types function with the cleaned list
test_df = convert_data_types(test_df, categorical_columns, target_type='str')
```

This corrected snippet should resolve the error by ensuring that only existing columns are passed to the `convert_data_types` function.
