The numerical features include measurements and counts related to the physical attributes of the houses such as lot size, number of rooms, and year built. The categorical features describe the qualitative aspects of the houses such as zoning, neighborhood, and building styles. \n\nNotable patterns:\n- Numerical features span a wide range of values, indicating diverse property sizes and attributes.\n- Categorical features include a mix of binary and multi-class categories.\n- Some features have missing values, e.g., Alley and LotFrontage, which might need imputation or special handling in model training.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **SalePrice**: This is the variable we are trying to predict. It represents the sale price of the house.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should include the following columns:\n- **Id**: The unique identifier for each house.\n- **SalePrice**: The predicted sale price for each house.\n\nBoth columns need to be present in the submission file, with 'Id' being an integer and 'SalePrice' being a numerical value.\nIn this phase, you have `train.csv` and `test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Address issues identified in the Preliminary EDA phase.\n2. Handle missing values using appropriate techniques.\n3. Treat outliers and anomalies.\n4.

If so, what were the reasons for these changes?**\n\n- **Removed Features:**\n  - Columns with more than **50%** missing values were removed (though specific columns were not listed in the code).\n  - The feature **'FireplaceQu'** was removed from the training dataset because it was not present in the test dataset.\n  \n- **No new features were created** during this phase.\n\n### Question 5\n**What transformations were applied to the data types of any features, and how do they align with the intended analysis for the next phase?**\n\n- **Transformations Applied:**\n  - Numerical columns were converted to **float** type.\n  - Categorical columns were converted to **string** type.\n  \n- **Alignment with Next Phase:**\n  - These transformations ensure that the data types are appropriate for modeling in the next phase, facilitating the application of machine learning algorithms that require numerical inputs and categorical features in string format.\n\n### Question 6\n**What are the key findings or patterns observed during the data cleaning process that should be further investigated in the exploratory analysis?**\n\n- **Key Findings:**\n  - The presence of many missing values in both numerical and categorical columns indicates potential areas for further investigation regarding their impact on house prices.\n  - The handling of outliers suggests that certain features may have a significant range of values that could influence the model's performance.\n  \n- **Further Investigation:**\n  - Analyzing the distribution of missing values and their relationships with other features could provide insights into whether certain variables are predictive of missingness.\n  - Exploring the attributes of the outliers may reveal specific characteristics of unique properties that could be valuable for feature engineering.\n\nThis summary provides a comprehensive overview of the data cleaning phase, ensuring clarity on the actions taken and their implications for the next steps in the analysis."

Answer with detailed file path.\n### Answer 1\nThe following files were processed:\n- **Input Files**:\n  - Train dataset: `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/train.csv`\n  - Test dataset: `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/test.csv`\n\n- **Generated Files**:\n  - Cleaned train dataset: `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train.csv`\n  - Cleaned test dataset: `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test.csv`\n\n### Question 2\nWhich features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features were deleted or created and provide detailed explanations. \n### Answer 2\n- **Involved Features**:\n  - **Numerical Features**: LotFrontage, MasVnrArea, GarageYrBlt, BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinSF2, BsmtUnfSF, TotalBsmtSF, BsmtFullBath, BsmtHalfBath, GarageCars, GarageArea.\n  - **Categorical Features**: Alley, PoolQC, Fence, MiscFeature, BsmtQual, BsmtCond, BsmtExposure, BsmtFinType1, BsmtFinType2, Electrical, GarageType, GarageFinish, GarageQual, GarageCond, MSZoning, Utilities, Exterior1st, Exterior2nd, KitchenQual, Functional, SaleType.\n\n- **Changes**:\n  - Missing values in numerical features were imputed with the **median**.\n  - Missing values in categorical features were filled with the string **'Missing'**.\n  - Outliers in LotArea, GrLivArea, and TotalBsmtSF were capped using the **IQR** method.\n  - The feature **'FireplaceQu'** was deleted from the training dataset as it was not present in the test dataset.\n\n### Question 3\nWhat discrepancies or inconsistencies were found between the training and test datasets, and how were they resolved?\n### Answer 3\nA discrepancy was found with the feature **'FireplaceQu'**, which was present in the training dataset but absent in the test dataset. To resolve this inconsistency, the feature **'FireplaceQu'** was removed from the training dataset to ensure uniformity between the two datasets.\n\n### Question 4\nWere any features removed or created during the data cleaning process? If so, what were the reasons for these changes?\n### Answer 4\n- **Removed Features**: \n  - Columns with more than **50%** missing values were removed (specific columns were not detailed in the code).\n  - The feature **'FireplaceQu'** was removed from the training dataset due to its absence in the test dataset.\n\n- **No new features** were created during this phase.\n\n### Question 5\nWhat transformations were applied to the data types of any features, and how do they align with the intended analysis for the next phase?\n### Answer 5\n- **Transformations Applied**:\n  - Numerical columns were converted to **float** type.\n  - Categorical columns were converted to **string** type.\n\n- **Alignment with Next Phase**: \n  These transformations ensure that the data types are appropriate for modeling in the next phase, facilitating the application of machine learning algorithms that require numerical inputs and categorical features in string format.\n\n### Question 6\nWhat are the key findings or patterns observed during the data cleaning process that should be further investigated in the exploratory analysis?\n### Answer 6\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - There were significant missing values in both numerical and categorical columns, indicating areas for further investigation regarding their impact on house prices.\n  - The handling of outliers suggests that certain features may have a significant range of values that could influence the model's performance.\n\n- **Further Investigation**:\n  - Analyzing the distribution of missing values and their relationships with other features could provide insights into whether certain variables predict missingness.\n  - Exploring the attributes of the outliers may reveal specific characteristics of unique properties valuable for feature engineering.\n```"
