Thank you for the clarification. Given the tools weren't specifically mentioned or predefined, let's re-examine the error and the code in a more focused manner.

The error message clearly points to an issue with the `train_data.corr()` line, where the presence of non-numeric data ('RL') is causing a failure in the correlation calculation. The `corr()` method needs all columns to be numeric, and the presence of categorical data is leading to this issue.

To recap:

```python
# Bivariate Analysis
# Correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = train_data.corr()
```

This snippet is the source of the error because `train_data` includes non-numeric columns that cannot be converted to floats, resulting in a `ValueError`.

Focusing on this specific line of code for this task, we identified the root cause effectively.
