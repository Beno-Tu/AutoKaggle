### Step 1: Analyze the Error

The error message indicates that there was an attempt to convert a string 'RL' to a float, which is not possible. This suggests that the DataFrame `train_data` contains non-numeric data.

The method `DataFrame.corr()` is used to compute pairwise correlation of columns, and it requires all columns to be numeric. Non-numeric columns will cause the method to fail.

### Step 2: Think About How to Correct the Error

To correct the error, we need to ensure that `train_data` only contains numeric columns when calling the `corr()` method. We can achieve this by selecting only the numeric columns from `train_data`.

### Step 3: Correct the Code Snippet

We will filter out non-numeric columns before computing the correlation matrix.

```python
# Bivariate Analysis
# Correlation matrix
numeric_train_data = train_data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
correlation_matrix = numeric_train_data.corr()
```

By using `select_dtypes(include=[np.number])`, we ensure that only columns with numeric data types are included in `numeric_train_data`, allowing the `corr()` method to execute without errors.

### Final Corrected Code Snippet

```python
# Bivariate Analysis
# Correlation matrix
numeric_train_data = train_data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
correlation_matrix = numeric_train_data.corr()
```
