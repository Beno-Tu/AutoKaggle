# In-Depth Exploratory Data Analysis Summary

## Question 1
### Key Statistical Insights from Univariate Analysis of Numerical Features
- **SalePrice**: Mean = $180,921, Std = $79,443, Min = $34,900, Max = $755,000.
- **LotArea**: Mean = 9,647 sq ft, Std = 3,594 sq ft, with values ranging from 1,481 to 17,673 sq ft.
- **GrLivArea**: Mean = 1,566 sq ft, Std = 505 sq ft, indicating a strong skew toward larger homes.
- **TotalBsmtSF**: Mean = 1,049 sq ft, Std = 436 sq ft, with a notable presence of homes having no basement.
- **OverallQual**: Mean = 6.1 (scale 1-10), Std = 1.38, suggesting a moderate overall quality across properties.
- **YearBuilt**: Mean = 1971, indicating a mix of older and newer homes.

## Question 2
### Numerical Features with Highest Correlation with `SalePrice`
- **OverallQual**: Strongest positive correlation (0.79).
- **GrLivArea**: Next strongest correlation (0.71).
- **TotalBsmtSF**: Moderate correlation (0.61).
- **GarageCars**: Correlation of 0.64.
- **Visualizations**: Scatter plots for `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, and `TotalBsmtSF` effectively illustrate these relationships, showing upward trends in sale prices with increases in these features.

## Question 3
### Patterns in Bivariate Analysis of Categorical Features
- **MSZoning**: `RL` has the highest median sale price (~$200,000) while `C (all)` is the lowest (~$75,000).
- **Neighborhood**: `NridgHt` shows the highest median sale prices, while `Meadow V` has the lowest. Variability in prices indicates affluent areas versus less desirable ones.
- **BldgType**: Single-family homes (`1Fam`) have higher sale prices compared to other types.
- **HouseStyle**: `2Story` homes tend to command higher prices, while `1Story` homes have moderate prices.

## Question 4
### Notable Feature Interactions Explored
- **OverallQual and YearBuilt**: Higher quality ratings typically correlate with newer construction dates.
- **GrLivArea and TotalBsmtSF**: Larger above-ground living areas tend to associate with larger basement areas.
- **Implications**: Interaction terms could be created, such as `OverallQual * YearBuilt`, to capture the combined effect on `SalePrice`.

## Question 5
### Impactful Visualizations and Insights
- **Pairwise scatter plots**: Show strong relationships between `GrLivArea`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `OverallQual`, and `SalePrice`.
- **Bar plots for OverallQual**: Clearly illustrate the strong positive correlation with sale price.
- **Recommendations for Feature Engineering**: Emphasize the importance of size (GrLivArea) and quality (OverallQual) features for predictive modeling.

## Question 6
### Recommendations for Feature Engineering
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Use imputation techniques for features with missing values, particularly for categorical variables like `Alley`, `PoolQC`, etc.
2. **Outlier Treatment**: Consider capping outliers in numerical features, especially `SalePrice`, to reduce skewness in data modeling.
3. **Create Interaction Features**: Develop features such as `OverallQual * YearBuilt` and create composite features combining `GrLivArea`, `TotalBsmtSF`, and `LotArea` for a holistic property size representation.
4. **Categorical Encoding**: Use one-hot encoding or target encoding for categorical variables like `Neighborhood` and `MSZoning` to capture their influence effectively.

These insights and recommendations aim to enhance feature representation for predictive modeling in the subsequent phases of the project.
