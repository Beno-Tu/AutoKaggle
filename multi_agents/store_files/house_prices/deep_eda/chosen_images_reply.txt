To proceed with the In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis phase, it’s essential to select images that will help in understanding the relationships between variables, their distributions, and how they may influence the target variable. Here's a breakdown of the images and their relevance:

1. **Bivariate Box Plots**: Useful for comparing the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories.
2. **Bivariate Scatter Plots**: Helps visualize the relationship between two numerical variables.
3. **Correlation Matrix**: Provides insight into the linear relationships between all pairs of variables.
4. **Overall Quality vs Sale Price**: A specific bivariate analysis that shows how overall quality affects the sale price.
5. **Pairwise Scatter Plots**: Allows for the examination of relationships between multiple pairs of variables.
6. **Univariate Numerical Histograms**: Useful for understanding the distribution of each numerical variable independently.

For in-depth analysis, the following images will be particularly relevant:

- **Bivariate Box Plots**
- **Bivariate Scatter Plots**
- **Correlation Matrix**
- **Overall Quality vs Sale Price**
- **Pairwise Scatter Plots**
- **Univariate Numerical Histograms**

Since we need to choose a total of 8 images but there are only 6 unique images listed, I will select all of them. Here’s the final selection:
