Based on the provided INFO and PLAN, here are six key questions designed to summarize the findings from the In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis phase and provide guidance for the next phase of Feature Engineering:

1. **What are the key statistical insights from the univariate analysis of numerical features, particularly those most correlated with `SalePrice`?**
   - **Purpose:** To summarize the distribution and central tendencies of numerical features, which will inform decisions about scaling, transformation, or binning during feature engineering.

2. **Which numerical features displayed the highest correlation with the target variable `SalePrice`, and what visualizations effectively communicate these relationships?**
   - **Purpose:** To identify the most influential numerical features for predicting `SalePrice`, guiding the selection of features for engineering new variables or interactions.

3. **What patterns or differences were observed in the bivariate analysis of categorical features against `SalePrice`, and which categorical features showed the most significant impact?**
   - **Purpose:** To highlight categorical variables that significantly affect the target variable, suggesting potential dummy variable creation or encoding strategies in feature engineering.

4. **Were there any notable interactions between features that were explored, and what implications do these interactions have for creating new features?**
   - **Purpose:** To identify potential feature interactions that could lead to enhanced predictive performance, guiding the formulation of new composite features based on identified relationships.

5. **What specific visualizations or insights emerged as the most impactful during the exploration of key features, and how can these insights direct feature engineering efforts?**
   - **Purpose:** To consolidate key findings from visual analyses that can inform the creation of new features or modifications to existing ones based on observed trends.

6. **What recommendations can be made for feature engineering based on the insights gained from the in-depth exploratory data analysis, particularly concerning handling missing values and outliers?**
   - **Purpose:** To provide a clear direction for the next phase, ensuring that the feature engineering process incorporates lessons learned regarding data quality and feature significance.

These questions encapsulate the essential findings from the exploratory analysis while offering a roadmap for effective feature engineering, ensuring a smooth transition to the next phase of the competition.
