Let's systematically address the issues identified in the code snippets and the test cases.

### Step 1: Analyze the Problems

#### For CODE SNIPPET 1:

The code snippet is responsible for one-hot encoding categorical features and aligning columns between the train and test datasets. 

**Problems Identified:**
1. The code snippet ensures the target column 'SalePrice' is removed from the test dataset before encoding, but it does not handle the scenario if 'SalePrice' is reintroduced afterward.
2. The alignment of columns between `train_df_copy` and `test_df_copy` does not ensure that `test_df_copy` lacks 'SalePrice' after reindexing.

**Test Cases Failing:**
- **Test Case 22:** The processed_train.csv file has different columns from processed_test.csv.
- **Test Case 20:** The target columns ['SalePrice'] are in the processed_test.csv file.

#### For CODE SNIPPET 2:

The code snippet standardizes numerical features and saves the datasets.

**Problems Identified:**
1. The target column `SalePrice` shouldn't be in the test dataset, but there is no check to ensure it has been removed before standardization.
2. Some numerical features might not be present in both train and test datasets.

### Step 2: Think about the Corrections

#### For CODE SNIPPET 1:
- Ensure 'SalePrice' is dropped from `test_df` before and after reindexing.
- Confirm that the reindexing step respects the absence of 'SalePrice' in `test_df_copy`.

#### For CODE SNIPPET 2:
- Ensure `SalePrice` is not in `test_df` before standardizing.
- Ensure that the columns to be standardized exist in both datasets.

### Step 3: Correct the Code Snippets

#### Corrected CODE SNIPPET 1:
```python
import pandas as pd

def one_hot_encode_features(train_df, test_df, columns, target_column='SalePrice'):
    train_df_copy = pd.get_dummies(train_df, columns=columns)
    
    # Ensure the target column is removed from the test dataset
    if target_column in test_df.columns:
        test_df = test_df.drop(columns=[target_column])
    
    test_df_copy = pd.get_dummies(test_df, columns=columns)
    
    # Align the columns of test_df with train_df
    test_df_copy = test_df_copy.reindex(columns=train_df_copy.columns, fill_value=0)
    
    # Ensure the target column is removed after reindexing
    if target_column in test_df_copy.columns:
        test_df_copy = test_df_copy.drop(columns=[target_column])
    
    return train_df_copy, test_df_copy

# Nominal features to one-hot encode
nominal_features = ['MSZoning', 'Street', 'Alley', 'Neighborhood', 'HouseStyle', 'RoofStyle', 'Condition1', 'Condition2', 'BldgType']

# Make sure the target column is not present in the test dataset before encoding
if 'SalePrice' in test_df_encoded.columns:
    test_df_encoded = test_df_encoded.drop(columns=['SalePrice'])

train_df_encoded, test_df_encoded = one_hot_encode_features(train_df_encoded, test_df_encoded, nominal_features)
```

#### Corrected CODE SNIPPET 2:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the encoded datasets
train_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train_encoded.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test_encoded.csv')

# Ensure the target column is removed from the test dataset before standardizing
if 'SalePrice' in test_df.columns:
    test_df = test_df.drop(columns=['SalePrice'])

# Columns to standardize
numerical_features = ['LotArea', 'GrLivArea', '1stFlrSF', '2ndFlrSF', 'TotalBsmtSF', 'HouseAge', 'OverallQual_SF']

# Ensure all numerical features exist in both datasets
numerical_features = [feature for feature in numerical_features if feature in train_df.columns and feature in test_df.columns]

# Standardize the numerical features
scaler = StandardScaler()
train_df[numerical_features] = scaler.fit_transform(train_df[numerical_features])
test_df[numerical_features] = scaler.transform(test_df[numerical_features])

# Save the standardized datasets
train_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/processed_train.csv', index=False)
test_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/processed_test.csv', index=False)
```

### Conclusion

With the above corrections:
- The `one_hot_encode_features` function ensures that 'SalePrice' is not present in the test dataset after reindexing.
- The numerical features are standardized only if they exist in both the train and test datasets, and 'SalePrice' is confirmed to be absent from `test_df` before standardization.

These changes should resolve the issues identified in the failing test cases.
