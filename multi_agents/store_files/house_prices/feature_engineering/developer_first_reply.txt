Great! Let's proceed with the feature engineering phase according to the plan. We'll implement each step in sequence, ensuring the constraints and requirements are met.

### STEP 1: Create New Features

#### Thought Process:
We will create new features based on the insights gained from our exploratory data analysis. These features aim to capture more information and potentially improve the model's performance.

#### Code:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the cleaned datasets
train_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test.csv')

# Function to create new features
def create_new_features(df):
    df_copy = df.copy()
    df_copy['HouseAge'] = df_copy['YrSold'] - df_copy['YearBuilt']
    df_copy['YearsSinceRemod'] = df_copy['YrSold'] - df_copy['YearRemodAdd']
    df_copy['TotalBath'] = df_copy['FullBath'] + 0.5 * df_copy['HalfBath'] + df_copy['BsmtFullBath'] + 0.5 * df_copy['BsmtHalfBath']
    df_copy['TotalPorchSF'] = df_copy['OpenPorchSF'] + df_copy['EnclosedPorch'] + df_copy['3SsnPorch'] + df_copy['ScreenPorch']
    df_copy['TotalSF'] = df_copy['TotalBsmtSF'] + df_copy['1stFlrSF'] + df_copy['2ndFlrSF']
    df_copy['OverallQual_SF'] = df_copy['OverallQual'] * df_copy['GrLivArea']
    return df_copy

# Create new features for both train and test datasets
train_df = create_new_features(train_df)
test_df = create_new_features(test_df)

# Save the datasets with new features
train_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train_with_new_features.csv', index=False)
test_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test_with_new_features.csv', index=False)

print("New features created and datasets saved.")

```

#### Explanation:
In this code block, we defined a function `create_new_features()` that takes a DataFrame as input and adds new calculated features. We then apply this function to both the training and test datasets, and save the modified datasets as new CSV files.

---

### STEP 2: Transform Existing Features

#### Thought Process:
To reduce skewness and make the data more suitable for linear models, we will apply a log transformation to certain numerical features.

#### Code:
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the datasets with new features
train_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train_with_new_features.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test_with_new_features.csv')

# Function to apply log1p transformation
def log_transform(df, columns):
    df_copy = df.copy()
    for col in columns:
        df_copy[col] = np.log1p(df_copy[col])
    return df_copy

# Columns to transform
log_transform_columns = ['LotArea', 'GrLivArea']
train_log_transform_columns = log_transform_columns + ['SalePrice']

# Apply log transformation
train_df_transformed = log_transform(train_df, train_log_transform_columns)
test_df_transformed = log_transform(test_df, log_transform_columns)

# Save the datasets
train_df_transformed.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train_log_transformed.csv', index=False)
test_df_transformed.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test_log_transformed.csv', index=False)

print("Log transformation applied and datasets saved.")
```

#### Explanation:
Here, we applied a `log1p` transformation to the specified columns to reduce skewness. The transformed datasets are saved as new CSV files.

---

### STEP 3: Handle Categorical Variables

#### Thought Process:
We will handle categorical variables by encoding them. Label encoding will be used for ordinal categories, and one-hot encoding will be used for nominal categories.

#### Code:
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Load the transformed datasets
train_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train_log_transformed.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test_log_transformed.csv')

# Function to label encode ordinal features
def label_encode_features(df, columns):
    df_copy = df.copy()
    le = LabelEncoder()
    for col in columns:
        df_copy[col] = le.fit_transform(df_copy[col])
    return df_copy

# Ordinal features to label encode
ordinal_features = ['ExterQual', 'ExterCond', 'BsmtQual', 'BsmtCond', 'HeatingQC', 'KitchenQual', 'GarageQual', 'GarageCond', 'PoolQC', 'Fence']

# Apply label encoding
train_df_encoded = label_encode_features(train_df, ordinal_features)
test_df_encoded = label_encode_features(test_df, ordinal_features)

# Function to one-hot encode nominal features
def one_hot_encode_features(train_df, test_df, columns):
    train_df_copy = pd.get_dummies(train_df, columns=columns)
    test_df_copy = pd.get_dummies(test_df, columns=columns)
    # Align the columns of test_df with train_df
    test_df_copy = test_df_copy.reindex(columns=train_df_copy.columns, fill_value=0)
    return train_df_copy, test_df_copy

# Nominal features to one-hot encode
nominal_features = ['MSZoning', 'Street', 'Alley', 'Neighborhood', 'HouseStyle', 'RoofStyle', 'Condition1', 'Condition2', 'BldgType']

# Apply one-hot encoding
train_df_encoded, test_df_encoded = one_hot_encode_features(train_df_encoded, test_df_encoded, nominal_features)

# Save the encoded datasets
train_df_encoded.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train_encoded.csv', index=False)
test_df_encoded.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test_encoded.csv', index=False)

print("Categorical variables encoded and datasets saved.")
```

#### Explanation:
This code block handles the encoding of categorical variables. Label encoding is used for ordinal features, and one-hot encoding is used for nominal features. The encoded datasets are then saved.

---

### STEP 4: Normalize or Standardize Numerical Features

#### Thought Process:
To ensure that numerical features are on a similar scale, we will standardize them using `StandardScaler`. This step is crucial for many machine learning algorithms.

#### Code:
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the encoded datasets
train_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train_encoded.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test_encoded.csv')

# Columns to standardize
numerical_features = ['LotArea', 'GrLivArea', '1stFlrSF', '2ndFlrSF', 'TotalBsmtSF', 'HouseAge', 'OverallQual_SF']

# Standardize the numerical features
scaler = StandardScaler()
train_df[numerical_features] = scaler.fit_transform(train_df[numerical_features])
test_df[numerical_features] = scaler.transform(test_df[numerical_features])

# Save the standardized datasets
train_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/processed_train.csv', index=False)
test_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/processed_test.csv', index=False)

print("Numerical features standardized and datasets saved.")
```

#### Explanation:
In this final step, we standardize the numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale. The standardized datasets are saved as `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`.

With these steps, we have completed the feature engineering phase, transforming and preparing the datasets for the next phase: Model Building, Validation, and Prediction.
