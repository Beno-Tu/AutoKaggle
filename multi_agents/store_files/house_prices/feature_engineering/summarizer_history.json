The train data includes 81 features, while the test data includes 80 features (excluding the target variable `SalePrice`). The features are a mix of numerical and categorical data that describe the properties of each house, such as location, size, condition, and various other attributes. Key observations include:\n\n- **Numerical Features**: These features include measurements and counts such as `LotArea`, `YearBuilt`, `GrLivArea`, and `SalePrice`. These are essential for understanding the scale and trends in the data.\n- **Categorical Features**: These features include qualitative attributes such as `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Neighborhood`, and `HouseStyle`. These are crucial for capturing the qualitative aspects of the houses.\n- **Missing Values**: Some features have missing values, such as `Alley`, `MasVnrArea`, and `GarageYrBlt`. These missing values need to be handled appropriately during data preprocessing.\n\nNotable patterns:\n- The dataset seems to represent a variety of house features and conditions which could significantly impact the sale price.\n- Features like `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, and `YearBuilt` likely have strong correlations with the target variable `SalePrice`.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **SalePrice**: This is the target variable representing the sale price of the houses in the train dataset. It is a numerical feature that will be the focus of prediction.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should include the following columns:\n- **Id**: The unique identifier for each property.\n- **SalePrice**: The predicted sale price for each property.\n\nThe file should be in CSV format with the columns `Id` and `SalePrice`.\nIn this phase, you have `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Create new features based on insights from the In-depth EDA.\n2. Transform existing features to improve model performance.\n3. Handle categorical variables (e.g., encoding).\n4. Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.\n5. Select the most relevant features for modeling if necessary.\n6. Other necessary feature engineering steps.\n7. Create `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`.\nOutput: Processed datasets (processed_train.csv and processed_test.csv).\n#############\n# PLAN #\n## PLAN\n\n### STEP 1\nTask: Create New Features\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** Pandas for data manipulation.\n- **Features:**\n  - `HouseAge = YrSold - YearBuilt`\n  - `YearsSinceRemod = YrSold - YearRemodAdd`\n  - `TotalBath = FullBath + 0.5 * HalfBath + BsmtFullBath + 0.5 * BsmtHalfBath`\n  - `TotalPorchSF = OpenPorchSF + EnclosedPorch + 3SsnPorch + ScreenPorch`\n  - `TotalSF = TotalBsmtSF + 1stFlrSF + 2ndFlrSF`\n  - `OverallQual_SF = OverallQual * GrLivArea`\nExpected output or Impact on data: New columns in both train and test datasets with the calculated features.\nConstraints: Ensure that the new features do not introduce multicollinearity or other issues.\n\n### STEP 2\nTask: Transform Existing Features\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** NumPy for applying `np.log1p()` transformation.\n- **Features:** `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `SalePrice` (for the training dataset).\nExpected output or Impact on data: Transformed features with reduced skewness, making the data more suitable for linear models.\nConstraints: Ensure that features containing zero or negative values are handled appropriately (e.g., adding a small constant before log transformation).\n\n### STEP 3\nTask: Handle Categorical Variables\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Label Encoding:**\n  - **Tools:** Sklearn's `LabelEncoder`.\n  - **Features:** `ExterQual`, `ExterCond`, `BsmtQual`, `BsmtCond`, `HeatingQC`, `KitchenQual`, `GarageQual`, `GarageCond`, `PoolQC`, `Fence`.\n- **One-Hot Encoding:**\n  - **Tools:** Pandas' `get_dummies()` function.\n  - **Features:** `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Alley`, `Neighborhood`, `HouseStyle`, `RoofStyle`, `Condition1`, `Condition2`, `BldgType`, etc.\nExpected output or Impact on data: New columns representing encoded categorical features.\nConstraints: Avoid excessive dimensionality; consider grouping rare categories or using target encoding.\n\n### STEP 4\nTask: Normalize or Standardize Numerical Features\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** Sklearn's `StandardScaler`.\n- **Features:** `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `1stFlrSF`, `2ndFlrSF`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `HouseAge`, etc.\nExpected output or Impact on data: Scaled numerical features in both train and test datasets.\nConstraints: Ensure scaling is applied consistently across train and test datasets, using the same parameters."

Answer with detailed file path.**\n\n- **Processed Files:**\n  - Input Files:\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train.csv`\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test.csv`\n  - Output Files:\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/processed_train.csv`\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/processed_test.csv`\n\n### Question 2\n**Which features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo?**\n\n- **New Features Created:**\n  - `HouseAge`: Calculated as `YrSold - YearBuilt`\n  - `YearsSinceRemod`: Calculated as `YrSold - YearRemodAdd`\n  - `TotalBath`: Combined total of different bath counts\n  - `TotalPorchSF`: Sum of different porch areas\n  - `TotalSF`: Sum of different floor areas\n  - `OverallQual_SF`: Interaction term between `OverallQual` and `GrLivArea`\n\n- **Transformed Features:**\n  - `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `SalePrice`: Log transformation applied to reduce skewness.\n\n- **Categorical Features Handled:**\n  - **Label Encoded:** `ExterQual`, `ExterCond`, `BsmtQual`, `BsmtCond`, `HeatingQC`, `KitchenQual`, `GarageQual`, `GarageCond`, `PoolQC`, `Fence`.\n  - **One-Hot Encoded:** `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Alley`, `Neighborhood`, `HouseStyle`, `RoofStyle`, `Condition1`, `Condition2`, `BldgType`.\n\n- **Deleted Features:** None noted in this phase.\n- **Modified Feature Types:** No feature types were modified; however, categorical features were transformed into numerical representations.\n\n### Question 3\n**What new features were created during this phase, and how do they relate to existing features?**\n\n- **New Features Created:**\n  - `HouseAge` and `YearsSinceRemod` provide insights into property age and renovations, which can significantly affect the sale price.\n  - `TotalBath` aggregates various bathroom counts into a single metric for simplification.\n  - `TotalPorchSF` and `TotalSF` summarize different areas of the house, emphasizing overall space.\n  - `OverallQual_SF` combines quality and livable area, aiming to capture interactions that affect pricing.\n\n### Question 4\n**Which existing features were transformed, and what impact did these transformations have on their distributions?**\n\n- **Transformed Features:**\n  - `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, and `SalePrice` underwent log transformation using `np.log1p()`.\n  \n- **Impact on Distributions:**\n  - The log transformation generally reduces skewness, making distributions more normal. This is beneficial for linear models and improves interpretability of feature effects.\n\n### Question 5\n**How were categorical variables handled, and what encoding methods were applied? Were there any challenges faced in this process?**\n\n- **Encoding Methods Applied:**\n  - **Label Encoding:** For ordinal categorical variables where the order matters.\n  - **One-Hot Encoding:** For nominal categorical variables to avoid ordinal assumptions.\n\n- **Challenges Faced:**\n  - Ensuring no excessive dimensionality from one-hot encoding. Columns were aligned between train and test datasets, maintaining consistency.\n  - Grouping rare categories might be necessary to reduce complexity, but this was not explicitly noted in the process.\n\n### Question 6\n**Based on the findings from this phase, what key features should be prioritized for inclusion in the modeling phase, and why?**\n\n- **Key Features to Prioritize:**\n  - `OverallQual_SF`: Strong interaction between quality and area.\n  - `TotalSF`: Represents the total livable space, likely correlating with price.\n  - `HouseAge` and `YearsSinceRemod`: Important for understanding depreciation and renovations.\n  - Log-transformed features (`LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `SalePrice`) to improve model performance by stabilizing variance.\n\n- **Rationale:**\n  - These features are expected to have high predictive power based on their relationships with `SalePrice` and their ability to capture significant variations in housing prices.\n\n---\n\nThis summary encapsulates the feature engineering phase, detailing the processes, transformations, and insights gained for the upcoming modeling phase."
