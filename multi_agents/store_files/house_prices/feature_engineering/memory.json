The train data includes 81 features, while the test data includes 80 features (excluding the target variable `SalePrice`). The features are a mix of numerical and categorical data that describe the properties of each house, such as location, size, condition, and various other attributes. Key observations include:\n\n- **Numerical Features**: These features include measurements and counts such as `LotArea`, `YearBuilt`, `GrLivArea`, and `SalePrice`. These are essential for understanding the scale and trends in the data.\n- **Categorical Features**: These features include qualitative attributes such as `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Neighborhood`, and `HouseStyle`. These are crucial for capturing the qualitative aspects of the houses.\n- **Missing Values**: Some features have missing values, such as `Alley`, `MasVnrArea`, and `GarageYrBlt`. These missing values need to be handled appropriately during data preprocessing.\n\nNotable patterns:\n- The dataset seems to represent a variety of house features and conditions which could significantly impact the sale price.\n- Features like `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, and `YearBuilt` likely have strong correlations with the target variable `SalePrice`.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **SalePrice**: This is the target variable representing the sale price of the houses in the train dataset. It is a numerical feature that will be the focus of prediction.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should include the following columns:\n- **Id**: The unique identifier for each property.\n- **SalePrice**: The predicted sale price for each property.\n\nThe file should be in CSV format with the columns `Id` and `SalePrice`.\n\nIn this phase, you have `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Create new features based on insights from the In-depth EDA.\n2. Transform existing features to improve model performance.\n3. Handle categorical variables (e.g., encoding).\n4. Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.\n5. Select the most relevant features for modeling if necessary.\n6. Other necessary feature engineering steps.\n7. Create `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`.\nOutput: Processed datasets (processed_train.csv and processed_test.csv).\n\n#############\n# NOTE #\n## PLANNING GUIDELINES ##\n1. Limit the plan to a MAXIMUM of FOUR tasks.\n2. Provide clear methods and constraints for each task.\n3. Focus on critical steps specific to the current phase.\n4.

For example, during the in-depth EDA phase:\n    - you CAN perform detailed univariate analysis on KEY features.\n    - you CAN NOT modify any feature or modify data.\n\n## DATA OUTPUT PREFERENCES ##\n1. Prioritize TEXT format (print) for statistical information.\n2. Print a description before outputting statistics.\n3. Generate images only if text description is inadequate.\n\n## METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS ##\n1. Provide highly detailed methods, especially for data cleaning.\n2. Specify actions for each feature without omissions.\n\n## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ##\n1. Consider runtime and efficiency, particularly for:\n   - Data visualization\n   - Large dataset handling\n   - Complex algorithms\n2. Limit generated images to a MAXIMUM of 10 for EDA.\n3. Focus on critical visualizations with valuable insights.\n\n## OPTIMIZATION EXAMPLE ##\nWhen using seaborn or matplotlib for large datasets:\n- Turn off unnecessary details (e.g., annot=False in heatmaps)\n- Prioritize efficiency in plot generation\n\n#############\n# TASK #\n\nPlease design plan that is clear and specific to each FEATURE for the current development phase: Feature Engineering. \nThe developer will execute tasks based on your plan. \nI will provide you with INFORMATION, RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, and previous reports and plans.\nYou can use the following reasoning pattern to design the plan:\n1.

The train data includes 81 features, while the test data includes 80 features (excluding the target variable `SalePrice`). The features are a mix of numerical and categorical data that describe the properties of each house, such as location, size, condition, and various other attributes. Key observations include:\n\n- **Numerical Features**: These features include measurements and counts such as `LotArea`, `YearBuilt`, `GrLivArea`, and `SalePrice`. These are essential for understanding the scale and trends in the data.\n- **Categorical Features**: These features include qualitative attributes such as `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Neighborhood`, and `HouseStyle`. These are crucial for capturing the qualitative aspects of the houses.\n- **Missing Values**: Some features have missing values, such as `Alley`, `MasVnrArea`, and `GarageYrBlt`. These missing values need to be handled appropriately during data preprocessing.\n\nNotable patterns:\n- The dataset seems to represent a variety of house features and conditions which could significantly impact the sale price.\n- Features like `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, and `YearBuilt` likely have strong correlations with the target variable `SalePrice`.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **SalePrice**: This is the target variable representing the sale price of the houses in the train dataset. It is a numerical feature that will be the focus of prediction.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should include the following columns:\n- **Id**: The unique identifier for each property.\n- **SalePrice**: The predicted sale price for each property.\n\nThe file should be in CSV format with the columns `Id` and `SalePrice`.\n    </background_info>",

                    "content": "Great! Let's proceed with the feature engineering phase according to the plan. We'll implement each step in sequence, ensuring the constraints and requirements are met.\n\n### STEP 1: Create New Features\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will create new features based on the insights gained from our exploratory data analysis. These features aim to capture more information and potentially improve the model's performance.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the cleaned datasets\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test.csv')\n\n# Function to create new features\ndef create_new_features(df):\n    df_copy = df.copy()\n    df_copy['HouseAge'] = df_copy['YrSold'] - df_copy['YearBuilt']\n    df_copy['YearsSinceRemod'] = df_copy['YrSold'] - df_copy['YearRemodAdd']\n    df_copy['TotalBath'] = df_copy['FullBath'] + 0.5 * df_copy['HalfBath'] + df_copy['BsmtFullBath'] + 0.5 * df_copy['BsmtHalfBath']\n    df_copy['TotalPorchSF'] = df_copy['OpenPorchSF'] + df_copy['EnclosedPorch'] + df_copy['3SsnPorch'] + df_copy['ScreenPorch']\n    df_copy['TotalSF'] = df_copy['TotalBsmtSF'] + df_copy['1stFlrSF'] + df_copy['2ndFlrSF']\n    df_copy['OverallQual_SF'] = df_copy['OverallQual'] * df_copy['GrLivArea']\n    return df_copy\n\n# Create new features for both train and test datasets\ntrain_df = create_new_features(train_df)\ntest_df = create_new_features(test_df)\n\n# Save the datasets with new features\ntrain_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train_with_new_features.csv', index=False)\ntest_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test_with_new_features.csv', index=False)\n\nprint(\"New features created and datasets saved.\")\n\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nIn this code block, we defined a function `create_new_features()` that takes a DataFrame as input and adds new calculated features. We then apply this function to both the training and test datasets, and save the modified datasets as new CSV files.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 2: Transform Existing Features\n\n#### Thought Process:\nTo reduce skewness and make the data more suitable for linear models, we will apply a log transformation to certain numerical features.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\n# Load the datasets with new features\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train_with_new_features.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test_with_new_features.csv')\n\n# Function to apply log1p transformation\ndef log_transform(df, columns):\n    df_copy = df.copy()\n    for col in columns:\n        df_copy[col] = np.log1p(df_copy[col])\n    return df_copy\n\n# Columns to transform\nlog_transform_columns = ['LotArea', 'GrLivArea']\ntrain_log_transform_columns = log_transform_columns + ['SalePrice']\n\n# Apply log transformation\ntrain_df_transformed = log_transform(train_df, train_log_transform_columns)\ntest_df_transformed = log_transform(test_df, log_transform_columns)\n\n# Save the datasets\ntrain_df_transformed.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train_log_transformed.csv', index=False)\ntest_df_transformed.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test_log_transformed.csv', index=False)\n\nprint(\"Log transformation applied and datasets saved.\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nHere, we applied a `log1p` transformation to the specified columns to reduce skewness. The transformed datasets are saved as new CSV files.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 3: Handle Categorical Variables\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will handle categorical variables by encoding them. Label encoding will be used for ordinal categories, and one-hot encoding will be used for nominal categories.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n\n# Load the transformed datasets\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train_log_transformed.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test_log_transformed.csv')\n\n# Function to label encode ordinal features\ndef label_encode_features(df, columns):\n    df_copy = df.copy()\n    le = LabelEncoder()\n    for col in columns:\n        df_copy[col] = le.fit_transform(df_copy[col])\n    return df_copy\n\n# Ordinal features to label encode\nordinal_features = ['ExterQual', 'ExterCond', 'BsmtQual', 'BsmtCond', 'HeatingQC', 'KitchenQual', 'GarageQual', 'GarageCond', 'PoolQC', 'Fence']\n\n# Apply label encoding\ntrain_df_encoded = label_encode_features(train_df, ordinal_features)\ntest_df_encoded = label_encode_features(test_df, ordinal_features)\n\n# Function to one-hot encode nominal features\ndef one_hot_encode_features(train_df, test_df, columns):\n    train_df_copy = pd.get_dummies(train_df, columns=columns)\n    test_df_copy = pd.get_dummies(test_df, columns=columns)\n    # Align the columns of test_df with train_df\n    test_df_copy = test_df_copy.reindex(columns=train_df_copy.columns, fill_value=0)\n    return train_df_copy, test_df_copy\n\n# Nominal features to one-hot encode\nnominal_features = ['MSZoning', 'Street', 'Alley', 'Neighborhood', 'HouseStyle', 'RoofStyle', 'Condition1', 'Condition2', 'BldgType']\n\n# Apply one-hot encoding\ntrain_df_encoded, test_df_encoded = one_hot_encode_features(train_df_encoded, test_df_encoded, nominal_features)\n\n# Save the encoded datasets\ntrain_df_encoded.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train_encoded.csv', index=False)\ntest_df_encoded.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test_encoded.csv', index=False)\n\nprint(\"Categorical variables encoded and datasets saved.\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code block handles the encoding of categorical variables. Label encoding is used for ordinal features, and one-hot encoding is used for nominal features. The encoded datasets are then saved.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 4: Normalize or Standardize Numerical Features\n\n#### Thought Process:\nTo ensure that numerical features are on a similar scale, we will standardize them using `StandardScaler`. This step is crucial for many machine learning algorithms.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\n# Load the encoded datasets\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train_encoded.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test_encoded.csv')\n\n# Columns to standardize\nnumerical_features = ['LotArea', 'GrLivArea', '1stFlrSF', '2ndFlrSF', 'TotalBsmtSF', 'HouseAge', 'OverallQual_SF']\n\n# Standardize the numerical features\nscaler = StandardScaler()\ntrain_df[numerical_features] = scaler.fit_transform(train_df[numerical_features])\ntest_df[numerical_features] = scaler.transform(test_df[numerical_features])\n\n# Save the standardized datasets\ntrain_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/processed_train.csv', index=False)\ntest_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/processed_test.csv', index=False)\n\nprint(\"Numerical features standardized and datasets saved.\")\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nIn this final step, we standardize the numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale. The standardized datasets are saved as `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`.\n\n---\n\nWith these steps, we have completed the feature engineering phase, transforming and preparing the datasets for the next phase: Model Building, Validation, and Prediction."

The train data includes 81 features, while the test data includes 80 features (excluding the target variable `SalePrice`). The features are a mix of numerical and categorical data that describe the properties of each house, such as location, size, condition, and various other attributes. Key observations include:\n\n- **Numerical Features**: These features include measurements and counts such as `LotArea`, `YearBuilt`, `GrLivArea`, and `SalePrice`. These are essential for understanding the scale and trends in the data.\n- **Categorical Features**: These features include qualitative attributes such as `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Neighborhood`, and `HouseStyle`. These are crucial for capturing the qualitative aspects of the houses.\n- **Missing Values**: Some features have missing values, such as `Alley`, `MasVnrArea`, and `GarageYrBlt`.

The train data includes 81 features, while the test data includes 80 features (excluding the target variable `SalePrice`). The features are a mix of numerical and categorical data that describe the properties of each house, such as location, size, condition, and various other attributes. Key observations include:\n\n- **Numerical Features**: These features include measurements and counts such as `LotArea`, `YearBuilt`, `GrLivArea`, and `SalePrice`. These are essential for understanding the scale and trends in the data.\n- **Categorical Features**: These features include qualitative attributes such as `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Neighborhood`, and `HouseStyle`. These are crucial for capturing the qualitative aspects of the houses.\n- **Missing Values**: Some features have missing values, such as `Alley`, `MasVnrArea`, and `GarageYrBlt`. These missing values need to be handled appropriately during data preprocessing.\n\nNotable patterns:\n- The dataset seems to represent a variety of house features and conditions which could significantly impact the sale price.\n- Features like `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, and `YearBuilt` likely have strong correlations with the target variable `SalePrice`.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **SalePrice**: This is the target variable representing the sale price of the houses in the train dataset. It is a numerical feature that will be the focus of prediction.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should include the following columns:\n- **Id**: The unique identifier for each property.\n- **SalePrice**: The predicted sale price for each property.\n\nThe file should be in CSV format with the columns `Id` and `SalePrice`.\n    </background_info>\n   <plan>\n##

 - `TotalSF = TotalBsmtSF + 1stFlrSF + 2ndFlrSF`\n  - `OverallQual_SF = OverallQual * GrLivArea`\nExpected output or Impact on data: New columns in both train and test datasets with the calculated features.\nConstraints: Ensure that the new features do not introduce multicollinearity or other issues.\n\n### STEP 2\nTask: Transform Existing Features\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** NumPy for applying `np.log1p()` transformation.\n- **Features:** `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `SalePrice` (for the training dataset).\nExpected output or Impact on data: Transformed features with reduced skewness, making the data more suitable for linear models.\nConstraints: Ensure that features containing zero or negative values are handled appropriately (e.g., adding a small constant before log transformation).\n\n### STEP 3\nTask: Handle Categorical Variables\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Label Encoding:**\n  - **Tools:** Sklearn's `LabelEncoder`.\n  - **Features:** `ExterQual`, `ExterCond`, `BsmtQual`, `BsmtCond`, `HeatingQC`, `KitchenQual`, `GarageQual`, `GarageCond`, `PoolQC`, `Fence`.\n- **One-Hot Encoding:**\n  - **Tools:** Pandas' `get_dummies()` function.\n  - **Features:** `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Alley`, `Neighborhood`, `HouseStyle`, `RoofStyle`, `Condition1`, `Condition2`, `BldgType`, etc.\nExpected output or Impact on data: New columns representing encoded categorical features.\nConstraints: Avoid excessive dimensionality; consider grouping rare categories or using target encoding.\n\n### STEP 4\nTask: Normalize or Standardize Numerical Features\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** Sklearn's `StandardScaler`.\n- **Features:** `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `1stFlrSF`, `2ndFlrSF`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `HouseAge`, etc.\nExpected output or Impact on data: Scaled numerical features in both train and test datasets.\nConstraints: Ensure scaling is applied consistently across train and

These are essential for understanding the scale and trends in the data.\n- **Categorical Features**: These features include qualitative attributes such as `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Neighborhood`, and `HouseStyle`. These are crucial for capturing the qualitative aspects of the houses.\n- **Missing Values**: Some features have missing values, such as `Alley`, `MasVnrArea`, and `GarageYrBlt`. These missing values need to be handled appropriately during data preprocessing.\n\nNotable patterns:\n- The dataset seems to represent a variety of house features and conditions which could significantly impact the sale price.\n- Features like `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, and `YearBuilt` likely have strong correlations with the target variable `SalePrice`.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **SalePrice**: This is the target variable representing the sale price of the houses in the train dataset. It is a numerical feature that will be the focus of prediction.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should include the following columns:\n- **Id**: The unique identifier for each property.\n- **SalePrice**: The predicted sale price for each property.\n\nThe file should be in CSV format with the columns `Id` and `SalePrice`.\n    </background_info>\n</INPUT>\n<EXECUTION RESULT>\n## PLAN\n\n### STEP 1\nTask: Create New Features\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** Pandas for data manipulation.\n- **Features:**\n  - `HouseAge = YrSold - YearBuilt`\n  - `YearsSinceRemod = YrSold - YearRemodAdd`\n  - `TotalBath = FullBath + 0.5 * HalfBath + BsmtFullBath + 0.5 * BsmtHalfBath`\n  - `TotalPorchSF = OpenPorchSF + EnclosedPorch + 3SsnPorch + ScreenPorch`\n  - `TotalSF = TotalBsmtSF + 1stFlrSF + 2ndFlrSF`\n  - `OverallQual_SF = OverallQual * GrLivArea`\nExpected output or Impact on data: New columns in both train and test datasets with the calculated features.\nConstraints: Ensure that the new features do not introduce multicollinearity or other issues.\n\n### STEP 2\nTask: Transform Existing Features\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** NumPy for applying `np.log1p()` transformation.\n- **Features:** `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `SalePrice` (for the training dataset).\nExpected output or Impact on data: Transformed features with reduced skewness, making the data more suitable for linear models.\nConstraints: Ensure that features containing zero or negative values are handled appropriately (e.g., adding a small constant before log transformation).\n\n### STEP 3\nTask: Handle Categorical Variables\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Label Encoding:**\n  - **Tools:** Sklearn's `LabelEncoder`.\n  - **Features:** `ExterQual`, `ExterCond`, `BsmtQual`, `BsmtCond`, `HeatingQC`, `KitchenQual`, `GarageQual`, `GarageCond`, `PoolQC`, `Fence`.\n- **One-Hot Encoding:**\n  - **Tools:** Pandas' `get_dummies()` function.\n  - **Features:** `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Alley`, `Neighborhood`, `HouseStyle`, `RoofStyle`, `Condition1`, `Condition2`, `BldgType`, etc.\nExpected output or Impact on data: New columns representing encoded categorical features.\nConstraints: Avoid excessive dimensionality; consider grouping rare categories or using target encoding.\n\n### STEP 4\nTask: Normalize or Standardize Numerical Features\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** Sklearn's `StandardScaler`.\n- **Features:** `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `1stFlrSF`, `2ndFlrSF`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `HouseAge`, etc.\nExpected output or Impact on data: Scaled numerical features in both train and test datasets.\nConstraints: Ensure scaling is applied consistently across train and test datasets, using the same parameters.\n</EXECUTION RESULT>\n\n"

The train data includes 81 features, while the test data includes 80 features (excluding the target variable `SalePrice`). The features are a mix of numerical and categorical data that describe the properties of each house, such as location, size, condition, and various other attributes. Key observations include:\n\n- **Numerical Features**: These features include measurements and counts such as `LotArea`, `YearBuilt`, `GrLivArea`, and `SalePrice`. These are essential for understanding the scale and trends in the data.\n- **Categorical Features**: These features include qualitative attributes such as `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Neighborhood`, and `HouseStyle`. These are crucial for capturing the qualitative aspects of the houses.\n- **Missing Values**: Some features have missing values, such as `Alley`, `MasVnrArea`, and `GarageYrBlt`. These missing values need to be handled appropriately during data preprocessing.\n\nNotable patterns:\n- The dataset seems to represent a variety of house features and conditions which could significantly impact the sale price.\n- Features like `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, and `YearBuilt` likely have strong correlations with the target variable `SalePrice`.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **SalePrice**: This is the target variable representing the sale price of the houses in the train dataset. It is a numerical feature that will be the focus of prediction.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should include the following columns:\n- **Id**: The unique identifier for each property.\n- **SalePrice**: The predicted sale price for each property.\n\nThe file should be in CSV format with the columns `Id` and `SalePrice`.\n\nIn this phase, you have `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Create new features based on insights from the In-depth EDA.\n2. Transform existing features to improve model performance.\n3. Handle categorical variables (e.g., encoding).\n4. Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.\n5. Select the most relevant features for modeling if necessary.\n6. Other necessary feature engineering steps.\n7. Create `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`.\nOutput: Processed datasets (processed_train.csv and processed_test.csv).\n\n#############\n# PLAN #\n## PLAN\n\n### STEP 1\nTask: Create New

Answer with detailed file path.**\n\n- **Processed Files:**\n  - Input Files:\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train.csv`\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test.csv`\n  - Output Files:\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/processed_train.csv`\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/processed_test.csv`\n\n### Question 2\n**Which features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo?**\n\n- **New Features Created:**\n  - `HouseAge`: Calculated as `YrSold - YearBuilt`\n  - `YearsSinceRemod`: Calculated as `YrSold - YearRemodAdd`\n  - `TotalBath`: Combined total of different bath counts\n  - `TotalPorchSF`: Sum of different porch areas\n  - `TotalSF`: Sum of different floor areas\n  - `OverallQual_SF`: Interaction term between `OverallQual` and `GrLivArea`\n\n- **Transformed Features:**\n  - `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `SalePrice`: Log transformation applied to reduce skewness.\n\n- **Categorical Features Handled:**\n  - **Label Encoded:** `ExterQual`, `ExterCond`, `BsmtQual`, `BsmtCond`, `HeatingQC`, `KitchenQual`, `GarageQual`, `GarageCond`, `PoolQC`, `Fence`.\n  - **One-Hot Encoded:** `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Alley`, `Neighborhood`, `HouseStyle`, `RoofStyle`, `Condition1`, `Condition2`, `BldgType`.\n\n- **Deleted Features:** None noted in this phase.\n- **Modified Feature Types:** No feature types were modified; however, categorical features were transformed into numerical representations.\n\n### Question 3\n**What new features were created during this phase, and how do they relate to existing features?**\n\n- **New Features Created:**\n  - `HouseAge` and `YearsSinceRemod` provide insights into property age and renovations, which can significantly affect the sale price.\n  - `TotalBath` aggregates various bathroom counts into a single metric for simplification.\n  - `TotalPorchSF` and `TotalSF` summarize different areas of the house, emphasizing overall space.\n  - `OverallQual_SF` combines quality and livable area, aiming to capture interactions that affect pricing.\n\n### Question 4\n**Which existing features were transformed, and what impact did these transformations have on their distributions?**\n\n- **Transformed Features:**\n  - `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, and `SalePrice` underwent log transformation using `np.log1p()`.\n  \n- **Impact on Distributions:**\n  - The log transformation generally reduces skewness, making distributions more normal. This is beneficial for linear models and improves interpretability of feature effects.\n\n### Question 5\n**How were categorical variables handled, and what encoding methods were applied? Were there any challenges faced in this process?**\n\n- **Encoding Methods Applied:**\n  - **Label Encoding:** For ordinal categorical variables where the order matters.\n  - **One-Hot Encoding:** For nominal categorical variables to avoid ordinal assumptions.\n\n- **Challenges Faced:**\n  - Ensuring no excessive dimensionality from one-hot encoding. Columns were aligned between train and test datasets, maintaining consistency.\n  - Grouping rare categories might be necessary to reduce complexity, but this was not explicitly noted in the process.\n\n### Question 6\n**Based on the findings from this phase, what key features should be prioritized for inclusion in the modeling phase, and why?**\n\n- **Key Features to Prioritize:**\n  - `OverallQual_SF`: Strong interaction between quality and area.\n  - `TotalSF`: Represents the total livable space, likely correlating with price.\n  - `HouseAge` and `YearsSinceRemod`: Important for understanding depreciation and renovations.\n  - Log-transformed features (`LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `SalePrice`) to improve model performance by stabilizing variance.\n\n- **Rationale:**\n  - These features are expected to have high predictive power based on their relationships with `SalePrice` and their ability to capture significant variations in housing prices.\n\n---\n\nThis summary encapsulates the feature engineering phase, detailing the processes, transformations, and insights gained for the upcoming modeling phase."
