Here are six key questions designed to summarize the findings from the Feature Engineering phase and provide guidance for the next phase of Model Building, Validation, and Prediction:

1. **What new features were created during this phase, and how do they relate to existing features?**
   - *Purpose*: This question will summarize the additional insights gained from the dataset. Understanding the relationships between new and existing features can help identify potential predictors for the model.

2. **Which existing features were transformed, and what impact did these transformations have on their distributions?**
   - *Purpose*: This question focuses on the effects of transformations (e.g., log transformations) on feature distributions. Insights into how these changes improve the model's ability to learn patterns will guide the choice of features for modeling.

3. **How were categorical variables handled, and what encoding methods were applied? Were there any challenges faced in this process?**
   - *Purpose*: This question addresses the strategies used for encoding categorical variables, which are crucial for model training. Identifying challenges can help refine these methods in the next phase.

4. **What numerical features were normalized or standardized, and what was the reasoning behind choosing specific features for scaling?**
   - *Purpose*: This question helps evaluate the rationale for scaling certain numerical features, ensuring that the model will be trained on data that is appropriately distributed.

5. **What potential issues, such as multicollinearity or excessive dimensionality, were identified during feature engineering, and how were they addressed?**
   - *Purpose*: This question aims to uncover any challenges encountered during the engineering process, as addressing these issues is essential for building an effective model.

6. **Based on the findings from this phase, what key features should be prioritized for inclusion in the modeling phase, and why?**
   - *Purpose*: This question will help summarize the most relevant features to focus on in the modeling phase, ensuring that the model is built on a strong foundation of important predictors.

These questions collectively summarize the achievements of the Feature Engineering phase while providing actionable insights for the subsequent phase of Model Building, Validation, and Prediction.
