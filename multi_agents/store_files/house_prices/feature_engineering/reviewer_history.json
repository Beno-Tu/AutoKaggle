The train data includes 81 features, while the test data includes 80 features (excluding the target variable `SalePrice`). The features are a mix of numerical and categorical data that describe the properties of each house, such as location, size, condition, and various other attributes. Key observations include:\n\n- **Numerical Features**: These features include measurements and counts such as `LotArea`, `YearBuilt`, `GrLivArea`, and `SalePrice`. These are essential for understanding the scale and trends in the data.\n- **Categorical Features**: These features include qualitative attributes such as `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Neighborhood`, and `HouseStyle`. These are crucial for capturing the qualitative aspects of the houses.\n- **Missing Values**: Some features have missing values, such as `Alley`, `MasVnrArea`, and `GarageYrBlt`. These missing values need to be handled appropriately during data preprocessing.\n\nNotable patterns:\n- The dataset seems to represent a variety of house features and conditions which could significantly impact the sale price.\n- Features like `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, and `YearBuilt` likely have strong correlations with the target variable `SalePrice`.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **SalePrice**: This is the target variable representing the sale price of the houses in the train dataset. It is a numerical feature that will be the focus of prediction.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should include the following columns:\n- **Id**: The unique identifier for each property.\n- **SalePrice**: The predicted sale price for each property.\n\nThe file should be in CSV format with the columns `Id` and `SalePrice`.\n    </background_info>\n   <plan>\n## PLAN\n\n### STEP 1\nTask: Create New Features\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** Pandas for data manipulation.\n- **Features:**\n  - `HouseAge = YrSold - YearBuilt`\n  - `YearsSinceRemod = YrSold - YearRemodAdd`\n  - `TotalBath = FullBath + 0.5 * HalfBath + BsmtFullBath + 0.5 * BsmtHalfBath`\n  - `TotalPorchSF = OpenPorchSF + EnclosedPorch + 3SsnPorch + ScreenPorch`\n  - `TotalSF = TotalBsmtSF + 1stFlrSF + 2ndFlrSF`\n  - `OverallQual_SF = OverallQual * GrLivArea`\nExpected output or Impact on data: New columns in both train and test datasets with the calculated features.\nConstraints: Ensure that the new features do not introduce multicollinearity or other issues.\n\n### STEP 2\nTask: Transform Existing Features\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** NumPy for applying `np.log1p()` transformation.\n- **Features:** `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `SalePrice` (for the training dataset).\nExpected output or Impact on data: Transformed features with reduced skewness, making the data more suitable for linear models.\nConstraints: Ensure that features containing zero or negative values are handled appropriately (e.g., adding a small constant before log transformation).\n\n### STEP 3\nTask: Handle Categorical Variables\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Label Encoding:**\n  - **Tools:** Sklearn's `LabelEncoder`.\n  - **Features:** `ExterQual`, `ExterCond`, `BsmtQual`, `BsmtCond`, `HeatingQC`, `KitchenQual`, `GarageQual`, `GarageCond`, `PoolQC`, `Fence`.\n- **One-Hot Encoding:**\n  - **Tools:** Pandas' `get_dummies()` function.\n  - **Features:** `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Alley`, `Neighborhood`, `HouseStyle`, `RoofStyle`, `Condition1`, `Condition2`, `BldgType`, etc.\nExpected output or Impact on data: New columns representing encoded categorical features.\nConstraints: Avoid excessive dimensionality; consider grouping rare categories or using target encoding.\n\n### STEP 4\nTask: Normalize or Standardize Numerical Features\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** Sklearn's `StandardScaler`.\n- **Features:** `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `1stFlrSF`, `2ndFlrSF`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `HouseAge`, etc.\nExpected output or Impact on data: Scaled numerical features in both train and test datasets.\nConstraints: Ensure scaling is applied consistently across train and test datasets, using the same parameters.\n    </plan>\n</INPUT>\n<EXECUTION RESULT>\nSure, here is the fully corrected code with the problematic snippets replaced with the corrected
