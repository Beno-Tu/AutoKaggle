Great, thanks for providing the previous report and the details about the cleaned datasets. Given the information and the tools available, we can now proceed to devise a specific and detailed plan for the Feature Engineering phase. Let's break down the tasks as follows:

### Task 1: Create New Features
**Objective:** Introduce new features that capture important relationships and additional information based on insights from the EDA phase.

**Actions:**
- **Create New Features Using Existing Data:**
  - **Age of the House:** 
    - **Formula:** `HouseAge = YrSold - YearBuilt`
    - **Features Involved:** `YrSold`, `YearBuilt`
  - **Years Since Last Renovation:**
    - **Formula:** `YearsSinceRemod = YrSold - YearRemodAdd`
    - **Features Involved:** `YrSold`, `YearRemodAdd`
  - **Total Bathrooms:**
    - **Formula:** `TotalBath = FullBath + 0.5 * HalfBath + BsmtFullBath + 0.5 * BsmtHalfBath`
    - **Features Involved:** `FullBath`, `HalfBath`, `BsmtFullBath`, `BsmtHalfBath`
  - **Total Porch Area:**
    - **Formula:** `TotalPorchSF = OpenPorchSF + EnclosedPorch + 3SsnPorch + ScreenPorch`
    - **Features Involved:** `OpenPorchSF`, `EnclosedPorch`, `3SsnPorch`, `ScreenPorch`
  - **Total Square Footage:**
    - **Formula:** `TotalSF = TotalBsmtSF + 1stFlrSF + 2ndFlrSF`
    - **Features Involved:** `TotalBsmtSF`, `1stFlrSF`, `2ndFlrSF`
  - **Overall Quality Times Square Footage:**
    - **Formula:** `OverallQual_SF = OverallQual * GrLivArea`
    - **Features Involved:** `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`
- **Tools:** Pandas for data manipulation.
- **Expected Output:** New columns in both train and test datasets with the calculated features.
- **Constraints:** Ensure that the new features do not introduce multicollinearity or other issues.

### Task 2: Transform Existing Features
**Objective:** Apply transformations to numerical features to normalize distributions and improve model performance.

**Actions:**
- **Log Transformations:** Apply log transformations to skewed numerical features to reduce skewness.
  - **Example Features:** `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `SalePrice` (for the training dataset).
  - **Tools:** NumPy for applying `np.log1p()` transformation.
  - **Expected Output:** Transformed features with reduced skewness, making the data more suitable for linear models.
  - **Constraints:** Ensure that features containing zero or negative values are handled appropriately (e.g., adding a small constant before log transformation).

### Task 3: Handle Categorical Variables
**Objective:** Convert categorical variables into numerical format suitable for machine learning models.

**Actions:**
- **Label Encoding:** Convert ordinal categorical features into numerical format.
  - **Example Features:** `ExterQual`, `ExterCond`, `BsmtQual`, `BsmtCond`, `HeatingQC`, `KitchenQual`, `GarageQual`, `GarageCond`, `PoolQC`, `Fence`.
  - **Tools:** Sklearn's `LabelEncoder`.
  - **Expected Output:** Ordinal categorical features encoded as integers.
  - **Constraints:** Ensure the encoding respects the ordinal nature of the features.
- **One-Hot Encoding:** Convert nominal categorical features into binary variables.
  - **Example Features:** `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Alley`, `Neighborhood`, `HouseStyle`, `RoofStyle`, `Condition1`, `Condition2`, `BldgType`, etc.
  - **Tools:** Pandas' `get_dummies()` function.
  - **Expected Output:** New columns representing one-hot encoded features.
  - **Constraints:** Avoid excessive dimensionality; consider grouping rare categories or using target encoding.

### Task 4: Normalize or Standardize Numerical Features
**Objective:** Scale numerical features to ensure uniformity and improve model performance.

**Actions:**
- **Standardization:** Apply standard scaling to numerical features to have mean=0 and standard deviation=1.
  - **Example Features:** `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `1stFlrSF`, `2ndFlrSF`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `HouseAge`, etc.
  - **Tools:** Sklearn's `StandardScaler`.
  - **Expected Output:** Scaled numerical features in both train and test datasets.
  - **Constraints:** Ensure scaling is applied consistently across train and test datasets, using the same parameters.

### Final Outputs
- **Processed Train Dataset:** `processed_train.csv`
- **Processed Test Dataset:** `processed_test.csv`

### Next Steps
1. **Implement the Detailed Steps:**
   - Use Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and transformation.
   - Utilize Sklearn tools for encoding and scaling.
2. **Verify and Validate:**
   - Ensure all transformations are applied consistently across both train and test datasets.
   - Validate the newly engineered features through basic statistical analysis to ensure they behave as expected.
3. **Save the Outputs:**
   - Save the processed train and test datasets to `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`.

By following this plan, you should be able to effectively engineer features that enhance the predictive power of your models. Let me know if you need further details or clarification on any specific step.
