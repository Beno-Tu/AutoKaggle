## Step-by-Step Summary of Feature Engineering Phase

### Question 1
**What files did you process? Which files were generated? Answer with detailed file path.**

- **Processed Files:**
  - Input Files:
    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_train.csv`
    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/cleaned_test.csv`
  - Output Files:
    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/processed_train.csv`
    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/house_prices/processed_test.csv`

### Question 2
**Which features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo?**

- **New Features Created:**
  - `HouseAge`: Calculated as `YrSold - YearBuilt`
  - `YearsSinceRemod`: Calculated as `YrSold - YearRemodAdd`
  - `TotalBath`: Combined total of different bath counts
  - `TotalPorchSF`: Sum of different porch areas
  - `TotalSF`: Sum of different floor areas
  - `OverallQual_SF`: Interaction term between `OverallQual` and `GrLivArea`

- **Transformed Features:**
  - `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `SalePrice`: Log transformation applied to reduce skewness.

- **Categorical Features Handled:**
  - **Label Encoded:** `ExterQual`, `ExterCond`, `BsmtQual`, `BsmtCond`, `HeatingQC`, `KitchenQual`, `GarageQual`, `GarageCond`, `PoolQC`, `Fence`.
  - **One-Hot Encoded:** `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Alley`, `Neighborhood`, `HouseStyle`, `RoofStyle`, `Condition1`, `Condition2`, `BldgType`.

- **Deleted Features:** None noted in this phase.
- **Modified Feature Types:** No feature types were modified; however, categorical features were transformed into numerical representations.

### Question 3
**What new features were created during this phase, and how do they relate to existing features?**

- **New Features Created:**
  - `HouseAge` and `YearsSinceRemod` provide insights into property age and renovations, which can significantly affect the sale price.
  - `TotalBath` aggregates various bathroom counts into a single metric for simplification.
  - `TotalPorchSF` and `TotalSF` summarize different areas of the house, emphasizing overall space.
  - `OverallQual_SF` combines quality and livable area, aiming to capture interactions that affect pricing.

### Question 4
**Which existing features were transformed, and what impact did these transformations have on their distributions?**

- **Transformed Features:**
  - `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, and `SalePrice` underwent log transformation using `np.log1p()`.
  
- **Impact on Distributions:**
  - The log transformation generally reduces skewness, making distributions more normal. This is beneficial for linear models and improves interpretability of feature effects.

### Question 5
**How were categorical variables handled, and what encoding methods were applied? Were there any challenges faced in this process?**

- **Encoding Methods Applied:**
  - **Label Encoding:** For ordinal categorical variables where the order matters.
  - **One-Hot Encoding:** For nominal categorical variables to avoid ordinal assumptions.

- **Challenges Faced:**
  - Ensuring no excessive dimensionality from one-hot encoding. Columns were aligned between train and test datasets, maintaining consistency.
  - Grouping rare categories might be necessary to reduce complexity, but this was not explicitly noted in the process.

### Question 6
**Based on the findings from this phase, what key features should be prioritized for inclusion in the modeling phase, and why?**

- **Key Features to Prioritize:**
  - `OverallQual_SF`: Strong interaction between quality and area.
  - `TotalSF`: Represents the total livable space, likely correlating with price.
  - `HouseAge` and `YearsSinceRemod`: Important for understanding depreciation and renovations.
  - Log-transformed features (`LotArea`, `GrLivArea`, `SalePrice`) to improve model performance by stabilizing variance.

- **Rationale:**
  - These features are expected to have high predictive power based on their relationships with `SalePrice` and their ability to capture significant variations in housing prices.
