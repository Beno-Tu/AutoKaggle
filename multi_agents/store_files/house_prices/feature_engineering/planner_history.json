The train data includes 81 features, while the test data includes 80 features (excluding the target variable `SalePrice`). The features are a mix of numerical and categorical data that describe the properties of each house, such as location, size, condition, and various other attributes. Key observations include:\n\n- **Numerical Features**: These features include measurements and counts such as `LotArea`, `YearBuilt`, `GrLivArea`, and `SalePrice`. These are essential for understanding the scale and trends in the data.\n- **Categorical Features**: These features include qualitative attributes such as `MSZoning`, `Street`, `Neighborhood`, and `HouseStyle`. These are crucial for capturing the qualitative aspects of the houses.\n- **Missing Values**: Some features have missing values, such as `Alley`, `MasVnrArea`, and `GarageYrBlt`. These missing values need to be handled appropriately during data preprocessing.\n\nNotable patterns:\n- The dataset seems to represent a variety of house features and conditions which could significantly impact the sale price.\n- Features like `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, and `YearBuilt` likely have strong correlations with the target variable `SalePrice`.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **SalePrice**: This is the target variable representing the sale price of the houses in the train dataset. It is a numerical feature that will be the focus of prediction.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should include the following columns:\n- **Id**: The unique identifier for each property.\n- **SalePrice**: The predicted sale price for each property.\n\nThe file should be in CSV format with the columns `Id` and `SalePrice`.\n\nIn this phase, you have `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Create new features based on insights from the In-depth EDA.\n2. Transform existing features to improve model performance.\n3. Handle categorical variables (e.g., encoding).\n4. Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.\n5. Select the most relevant features for modeling if necessary.\n6. Other necessary feature engineering steps.\n7. Create `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`.\nOutput: Processed datasets (processed_train.csv and processed_test.csv).\n\n#############\n# NOTE #\n## PLANNING GUIDELINES ##\n1. Limit the plan to a MAXIMUM of FOUR tasks.\n2. Provide clear methods and constraints for each task.\n3. Focus on critical steps specific to the current phase.\n4. Prioritize methods and values mentioned in USER RULES.\n5. Offer detailed plans without writing actual code.\n6. ONLY focus on tasks relevant to this phase, avoiding those belonging to other phases. For example, during the in-depth EDA phase:\n    - you CAN perform detailed univariate analysis on KEY features.\n    - you CAN NOT modify any feature or modify data.\n\n## DATA OUTPUT PREFERENCES ##\n1. Prioritize TEXT format (print) for statistical information.\n2. Print a description before outputting statistics.\n3. Generate images only if text description is inadequate.\n\n## METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS ##\n1. Provide highly detailed methods, especially for data cleaning.\n2. Specify actions for each feature without omissions.\n\n## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ##\n1. Consider runtime and efficiency, particularly for:\n   - Data visualization\n   - Large dataset handling\n   - Complex algorithms\n2. Limit generated images to a MAXIMUM of 10 for EDA.\n3. Focus on critical visualizations with valuable insights.\n\n## OPTIMIZATION EXAMPLE ##\nWhen using seaborn or matplotlib for large datasets:\n- Turn off unnecessary details (e.g., annot=False in heatmaps)\n- Prioritize efficiency in plot generation\n\n#############\n# TASK #\n\nPlease design plan that is clear and specific to each FEATURE for the current development phase: Feature Engineering. \nThe developer will execute tasks based on your plan. \nI will provide you with INFORMATION, RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, and previous reports and plans.\nYou can use the following reasoning pattern to design the plan:\n1. Break down the task into smaller steps.\n2.

What are the parameters of the tool?\"\n    - \"What are the expected output of each action? What is the impact of the action on the data?\"\n    - \"What are the constraints of this step?\"\n\n\n#############\n# RESPONSE #\nLet's work this out in a step by step way.\n\n#############\n# START PLANNING #\nBefore you begin, please request the following documents from me, which contain important information that will guide your planning:\n1.
