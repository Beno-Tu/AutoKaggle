Understand Background\n2. Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis\n3. Data Cleaning\n4. In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis\n5. Feature Engineering\n6. Model Building, Validation, and Prediction\nCurrently, I am at phase: Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis.\n\n#############\n# INFORMATION #\nData preview:\n# Data Information\n\n## Data Type\n\n### ID type\n- id\n\n### Numerical type\n- Age\n- Height\n- Weight\n- FCVC\n- NCP\n- CH2O\n- FAF\n- TUE\n\n### Categorical type\n- Gender\n- family_history_with_overweight\n- FAVC\n- CAEC\n- SMOKE\n- SCC\n- CALC\n- MTRANS\n\n### Datetime type\n- None\n\n## Detailed data description\nThe dataset provided includes both training and testing data, with a total of 18 features and one target variable (`NObeyesdad`). Below is a description of the features:\n\n- **id**: Unique identifier for each data point.\n- **Gender**: Categorical feature indicating the gender of the individual (Male or Female).\n- **Age**: Numerical feature representing the age of the individual.\n- **Height**: Numerical feature representing the height of the individual in meters.\n- **Weight**: Numerical feature representing the weight of the individual in kilograms.\n- **family_history_with_overweight**: Categorical feature indicating whether the individual has a family history of being overweight (yes or no).\n- **FAVC**: Categorical feature indicating whether the individual frequently consumes high-calorie food (yes or no).\n- **FCVC**: Numerical feature representing the frequency of vegetable consumption.\n- **NCP**: Numerical feature indicating the number of main meals.\n- **CAEC**: Categorical feature representing the frequency of food consumption between meals (Always, Frequently, Sometimes, or no).\n- **SMOKE**: Categorical feature indicating whether the individual smokes (yes or no).\n- **CH2O**: Numerical feature representing the daily water intake in liters.\n- **SCC**: Categorical feature indicating whether the individual monitors their calorie intake (yes or no).\n- **FAF**: Numerical feature representing the frequency of physical activity per week.\n- **TUE**: Numerical feature indicating the time spent using technology devices per day.\n- **CALC**: Categorical feature indicating the frequency of alcohol consumption (Always, Frequently, Sometimes, or no).\n- **MTRANS**: Categorical feature representing the main mode of transportation (Automobile, Public_Transportation, etc.).\n\n### Notable Patterns and Characteristics\n- Most individuals have a family history of being overweight and frequently consume high-calorie food.\n- The frequency of vegetable consumption (FCVC) and the number of main meals (NCP) vary among individuals.\n- The majority of individuals do not smoke and do not monitor their calorie intake.\n- The frequency of physical activity (FAF) and time spent using technology (TUE) show significant variation.\n- Public transportation is the most common mode of transportation.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **NObeyesdad**: This is a categorical target variable indicating the obesity level of the individual. It includes categories such as Insufficient_Weight, Normal_Weight, Overweight_Level_I, Overweight_Level_II, Obesity_Type_I, Obesity_Type_II, and Obesity_Type_III.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nFor submission, the file should include the following columns:\n- **id**: Unique identifier for each data point.\n- **NObeyesdad**: Predicted obesity level for each individual.\n\nEach column should retain its original data type, with `id` being an integer and `NObeyesdad` being a categorical string.\n\nIn this phase, you have `train.csv` and `test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Perform initial data exploration on both datasets.\n2. Identify basic statistics, data types, and distributions.\n3. Detect potential issues like missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.\n4. Provide insights to guide the subsequent Data Cleaning phase.\n\n\n#############\n# NOTE #\n## PLANNING GUIDELINES ##\n1. Limit the plan to a MAXIMUM of FOUR tasks.\n2. Provide clear methods and constraints for each task.\n3. Focus on critical steps specific to the current phase.\n4. Prioritize methods and values mentioned in USER RULES.\n5. Offer detailed plans without writing actual code.\n6. ONLY focus on tasks relevant to this phase, avoiding those belonging to other phases. For example, during the in-depth EDA phase:\n    - you CAN perform detailed univariate analysis on KEY features.\n    - you CAN NOT modify any feature or modify data.\n\n## DATA OUTPUT PREFERENCES ##\n1. Prioritize TEXT format (print) for statistical information.\n2. Print a description before outputting statistics.\n3. Generate images only if text description is inadequate.\n\n## METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS ##\n1. Provide highly detailed methods, especially for data cleaning.\n2. Specify actions for each feature without omissions.\n\n## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ##\n1. Consider runtime and efficiency, particularly for:\n   - Data visualization\n   - Large dataset handling\n   - Complex algorithms\n2. Limit generated images to a MAXIMUM of 10 for EDA.\n3. Focus on critical visualizations with valuable insights.\n\n## OPTIMIZATION EXAMPLE ##\nWhen using seaborn or matplotlib for large datasets:\n- Turn off unnecessary details (e.g., annot=False in heatmaps)\n- Prioritize efficiency in plot generation\n\n#############\n# TASK #\n\nPlease design plan that is clear and specific to each FEATURE for the current development phase: Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis. \nThe developer will execute tasks based on your plan. \nI will provide you with INFORMATION, RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, and previous reports and plans.\nYou can use the following reasoning pattern to design the plan:\n1. Break down the task into smaller steps.\n2. For each step, ask yourself and answer:\n    - \"What is the objective of this step?\"\n    - \"What are the essential actions to achieve the objective?\"\n    - \"What features are involved in each action?\"\n    - \"Which tool can be used for each action? What are the parameters of the tool?\"\n    - \"What are the expected output of each action? What is the impact of the action on the data?\"\n    - \"What are the constraints of this step?\"\n\n\n#############\n# RESPONSE #\nLet's work this out in a step by step way.\n\n#############\n# START PLANNING #\nBefore you begin, please request the following documents from me, which contain important information that will guide your planning:\n1. Report and plan from the previous phase\n2. Available tools in this phase\n3. Sample data for analysis\n"
