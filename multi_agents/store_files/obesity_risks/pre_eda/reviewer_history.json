Let's proceed with the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis phase according to the plan. We'll use the available libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform our tasks. Here's the complete implementation:\n\n### TASK 1: Load and Inspect the Data\n\n#### THOUGHT PROCESS:\nWe need to load the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files into DataFrames and inspect their structure to ensure they are loaded correctly. We'll display the first few rows and gather summary information about the data types and non-null counts.\n\n#### CODE:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Define file paths\ntrain_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/train.csv'\ntest_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/test.csv'\n\n# Load the datasets\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv(train_path)\ntest_df = pd.read_csv(test_path)\n\n# Display the first few rows of the train and test datasets\nprint(\"Train DataFrame Head:\")\nprint(train_df.head())\n\nprint(\"\\nTest DataFrame Head:\")\nprint(test_df.head())\n\n# Summary information including data types and non-null counts\nprint(\"\\nTrain DataFrame Info:\")\nprint(train_df.info())\n\nprint(\"\\nTest DataFrame Info:\")\nprint(test_df.info())\n```\n\n#### EXPLANATION:\n- We use `pandas.read_csv` to load the training and testing datasets from the specified paths.\n- The `head()` method is used to display the first few rows of each DataFrame.\n- The `info()` method provides a summary of the DataFrame, including data types and non-null counts.\n\n### TASK 2: Basic Statistical Analysis\n\n#### THOUGHT PROCESS:\nWe need to generate summary statistics for numerical features and frequency distributions for categorical features. This will help us understand the distribution and central tendencies of the data.\n\n#### CODE:\n```python\n# Basic statistical analysis for numerical features\nprint(\"\\nTrain DataFrame Numerical Features Description:\")\nprint(train_df.describe())\n\n# Frequency distribution for categorical features\ncategorical_features = ['Gender', 'family_history_with_overweight', 'FAVC', 'CAEC', 'SMOKE', 'SCC', 'CALC', 'MTRANS']\n\nprint(\"\\nTrain DataFrame Categorical Features Value Counts:\")\nfor feature in categorical_features:\n    print(f\"\\nValue counts for {feature}:\")\n    print(train_df[feature].value_counts())\n```\n\n#### EXPLANATION:\n- The `describe()` method provides summary statistics for numerical features.\n- We loop through the categorical features and use the `value_counts()` method to display the frequency distribution of each categorical feature.\n\n### TASK 3: Identify Missing Values and Inconsistencies\n\n#### THOUGHT PROCESS:\nWe need to identify missing values and potential outliers in the dataset. Missing values can cause issues during model training, while outliers can skew the results.\n\n#### CODE:\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Identify missing values\nprint(\"\\nMissing Values in Train DataFrame:\")\nprint(train_df.isnull().sum())\n\nprint(\"\\nMissing Values in Test DataFrame:\")\nprint(test_df.isnull().sum())\n\n# Boxplots for numerical features to identify potential outliers\nnumerical_features = ['Age', 'Height', 'Weight', 'FCVC', 'NCP', 'CH2O', 'FAF', 'TUE']\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(15, 10))\ntrain_df[numerical_features].boxplot()\nplt.title(\"Boxplot for Numerical Features in Train DataFrame\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/pre_eda/images/numerical_features_boxplot.png')\nplt.close()\n```\n\n#### EXPLANATION:\n- We use the `isnull().sum()` method to count the missing values for each column.\n- A boxplot is created for numerical features to visualize potential outliers. The boxplot is saved to the specified directory.\n\n### TASK 4: Initial Data Visualization\n\n#### THOUGHT PROCESS:\nWe will create visualizations to gain insights into the distribution of numerical features and the frequency of categorical features. This will help us better understand the dataset's structure and relationships.\n\n#### CODE:\n```python\n# Histograms for numerical features\nfor feature in numerical_features:\n    plt.figure()\n    train_df[feature].hist(bins=30)\n    plt.title(f'Histogram of {feature}')\n    plt.xlabel(feature)\n    plt.ylabel('Frequency')\n    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/pre_eda/images/histogram_{feature}.png')\n    plt.close()\n\n# Bar charts for categorical features\nfor feature in categorical_features:\n    plt.figure()\n    train_df[feature].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')\n    plt.title(f'Bar Chart of {feature}')\n    plt.xlabel(feature)\n    plt.ylabel('Frequency')\n    plt.savefig(f'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/pre_eda/images/bar_chart_{feature}.png')\n    plt.close()\n\n# Pairplot for key numerical features\nsns.pairplot(train_df[numerical_features])\nplt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/pre_eda/images/pairplot_numerical_features.png')\nplt.close()\n\n# Heatmap showing correlations between numerical features\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\ncorrelation_matrix = train_df[numerical_features].corr()\nsns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=False, cmap='coolwarm')\nplt.title('Correlation Heatmap of Numerical Features')\nplt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/pre_eda/images/correlation_heatmap.png')\nplt.close()\n```\n\n#### EXPLANATION:\n- Histograms are created for numerical features to visualize their distributions.\n- Bar charts are created for categorical features to show their frequency distributions.\n- A pairplot is generated for key numerical features to visualize their pairwise relationships.\n- A heatmap is created to show the correlations between numerical features. Each plot is saved to the specified directory.\n\nWith this code, we have completed the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis phase. The generated insights will guide us in the subsequent Data Cleaning phase.\n</EXECUTION RESULT>\n\n"
