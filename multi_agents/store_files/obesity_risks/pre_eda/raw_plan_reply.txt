Great, thanks for the information. Let's break down the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis phase into specific tasks. The objectives here are to understand the data's basic structure, identify any immediate issues, and gather initial insights that will guide the Data Cleaning phase. 

### Task 1: Load and Inspect the Data

**Objective:** 
To load the datasets and get a basic understanding of their structure and content.

**Actions:**
- Load the `train.csv` and `test.csv` datasets using pandas.
- Display the first few rows of each dataset to understand the structure.
- Print the summary information of both datasets (e.g., using `data.info()`).

**Features Involved:** 
All features in both `train.csv` and `test.csv`.

**Tools:** 
Pandas (`read_csv`, `head`, `info`).

**Expected Output:** 
- The first few rows of the train and test datasets.
- Summary information including data types and non-null counts.

**Constraints:**
- Ensure the datasets are loaded correctly and are in a DataFrame format.

### Task 2: Basic Statistical Analysis

**Objective:** 
To understand the basic statistics of numerical features and the distribution of categorical features.

**Actions:**
- Calculate and print summary statistics for numerical features (e.g., using `data.describe()`).
- Calculate and print the frequency distribution of categorical features (e.g., using `data['feature'].value_counts()`).

**Features Involved:** 
- Numerical: `Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, `FCVC`, `NCP`, `CH2O`, `FAF`, `TUE`
- Categorical: `Gender`, `family_history_with_overweight`, `FAVC`, `CAEC`, `SMOKE`, `SCC`, `CALC`, `MTRANS`

**Tools:** 
Pandas (`describe`, `value_counts`).

**Expected Output:** 
- Summary statistics for numerical features.
- Frequency distribution for categorical features.

**Constraints:**
- Ensure all statistics are printed in a clear and understandable format.

### Task 3: Identify Missing Values and Inconsistencies

**Objective:** 
To detect missing values and any obvious data inconsistencies.

**Actions:**
- Check for missing values in both datasets (e.g., using `data.isnull().sum()`).
- Identify any columns with missing values and the count of missing values in each.
- Check for inconsistencies such as outliers in numerical features (e.g., using boxplots).

**Features Involved:** 
All features.

**Tools:** 
Pandas (`isnull`, `sum`), Matplotlib/Seaborn (boxplots).

**Expected Output:** 
- List of features with missing values and their counts.
- Boxplots for numerical features to identify potential outliers.

**Constraints:**
- Ensure the process is efficient and does not generate excessive output.

### Task 4: Initial Data Visualization

**Objective:** 
To visually explore the data distributions and relationships between features.

**Actions:**
- Plot histograms for numerical features to understand their distributions.
- Plot bar charts for categorical features to visualize their frequency distributions.
- Create a pairplot to examine relationships between key numerical features (if feasible).
- Generate a heatmap to visualize correlations between numerical features.

**Features Involved:** 
All features.

**Tools:** 
Matplotlib/Seaborn (histograms, bar charts, pairplot, heatmap).

**Expected Output:** 
- Histograms for numerical features.
- Bar charts for categorical features.
- Pairplot for key numerical features.
- Heatmap showing correlations between numerical features.

**Constraints:**
- Limit the number of plots to a maximum of 10.
- Ensure plots are clear and provide valuable insights.

### Summary
