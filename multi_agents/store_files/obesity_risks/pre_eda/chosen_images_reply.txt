To conduct a Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we want to select images that give insights into the distributions of variables, relationships between them, and categorical breakdowns. 

Here's a step-by-step reasoning for the selection:

1. **Bar Charts**: These are useful for visualizing categorical data and understanding the distribution of different groups.
   - `bar_chart_CAEC.png`: Shows the relationship with daily calorie consumption.
   - `bar_chart_CALC.png`: Provides insight into calorie consumption.
   - `bar_chart_family_history_with_overweight.png`: Important for understanding genetic factors in obesity.
   - `bar_chart_FAVC.png`: Shows the frequency of fast food consumption.
   - `bar_chart_Gender.png`: Useful to see gender distribution in the dataset.
   - `bar_chart_MTRANS.png`: Visualizes transportation modes, relevant to physical activity levels.
   - `bar_chart_SMOKE.png`: Important for understanding lifestyle choices related to obesity.

2. **Correlation Heatmap**: This helps in understanding how numerical variables are related to each other, which is crucial for feature selection.
   - `correlation_heatmap.png`: Provides a comprehensive view of correlations among numerical features.

3. **Histograms**: These are useful for examining the distribution of numerical variables.
   - `histogram_Age.png`: To visualize the age distribution.
   - `histogram_Weight.png`: Important for understanding the weight distribution, directly related to obesity.

Given this analysis, here are the selected images:

```json
{
    "images": [
        "bar_chart_CAEC.png",
        "bar_chart_CALC.png",
        "bar_chart_family_history_with_overweight.png",
        "bar_chart_FAVC.png",
        "bar_chart_Gender.png",
        "bar_chart_MTRANS.png",
        "bar_chart_SMOKE.png",
        "correlation_heatmap.png"
    ]
}
