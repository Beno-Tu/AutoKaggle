Here are the six key questions designed to summarize the findings from the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis phase and provide guidance for the next phase of Data Cleaning:

1. **What datasets were processed, and what preliminary statistics were generated for both the training and testing datasets?**
   - *Purpose:* This question ensures that the planner has a clear record of which datasets were analyzed and the key statistics that emerged from the analysis, helping to track progress and identify areas needing further attention in the cleaning phase.

2. **Which features exhibited missing values, and what were their respective proportions?**
   - *Purpose:* Understanding the extent of missing values is crucial for the Data Cleaning phase. This question helps prioritize which features may require imputation or removal based on the severity of the missing data.

3. **What outliers were identified in the numerical features, and which features were most affected?**
   - *Purpose:* Outliers can significantly impact modeling efforts. This question helps highlight features that may need transformation or special handling in the cleaning process.

4. **What inconsistencies or anomalies were found in categorical features, particularly in their value distributions?**
   - *Purpose:* Identifying inconsistencies in categorical features can guide the cleaning process, ensuring that categories are standardized and correctly encoded for analysis.

5. **Were there any notable correlations or patterns observed among the features that could influence data cleaning decisions?**
   - *Purpose:* Insights from feature correlations can inform which features to focus on during cleaning, especially if certain features are highly correlated and might be redundant.

6. **What specific recommendations or actions should be taken in the Data Cleaning phase based on the findings from the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis?**
   - *Purpose:* This question synthesizes the findings into actionable steps, guiding the planner on what to prioritize in the Data Cleaning phase to ensure the dataset is ready for further analysis and modeling.

These questions are designed to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the findings and provide a clear pathway for the next steps in the data cleaning process.
