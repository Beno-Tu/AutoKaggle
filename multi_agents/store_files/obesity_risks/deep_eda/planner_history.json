Understand Background\n2. Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis\n3. Data Cleaning\n4. In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis\n5. Feature Engineering\n6. Model Building, Validation, and Prediction\nCurrently, I am at phase: In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis.\n\n#############\n# INFORMATION #\nData preview:\n# Data Information\n\n## Data Type\n\n### ID type\n- `id`\n\n### Numerical type\n- `Age`\n- `Height`\n- `Weight`\n- `FCVC` (Frequency of consumption of vegetables)\n- `NCP` (Number of main meals)\n- `CH2O` (Consumption of water)\n- `FAF` (Physical activity frequency)\n- `TUE` (Time using technology)\n\n### Categorical type\n- `Gender`\n- `family_history_with_overweight`\n- `FAVC` (Frequent consumption of high caloric food)\n- `CAEC` (Consumption of food between meals)\n- `SMOKE`\n- `SCC` (Monitoring of caloric consumption)\n- `CALC` (Consumption of alcohol)\n- `MTRANS` (Transportation used)\n- `NObeyesdad` (Target variable)\n\n### Datetime type\n- None\n\n## Detailed data description\nThe provided data consists of various features related to individuals' demographic information, lifestyle habits, and physical attributes. Here are some notable patterns and characteristics:\n\n- The `Gender` feature is binary (male, female).\n- The `family_history_with_overweight` feature indicates whether there is a family history of being overweight.\n- `FAVC`, `SMOKE`, `SCC`, and `CALC` are binary indicators (yes, no) of specific lifestyle choices or behaviors.\n- `FCVC`, `NCP`, `CH2O`, `FAF`, and `TUE` are numerical features representing the frequency or quantity of certain behaviors or attributes.\n- `CAEC` and `MTRANS` are categorical features representing the frequency of consumption of food between meals and the mode of transportation used, respectively.\n- The target variable `NObeyesdad` represents different levels of obesity and weight status: Normal_Weight, Insufficient_Weight, Overweight_Level_I, Overweight_Level_II, Obesity_Type_I, Obesity_Type_II, and Obesity_Type_III.\n\n## Target Variable\n- `NObeyesdad`: This is the target variable indicating the obesity level of individuals. It includes categories such as Normal_Weight, Insufficient_Weight, Overweight_Level_I, Overweight_Level_II, Obesity_Type_I, Obesity_Type_II, and Obesity_Type_III.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should include predictions for the target variable `NObeyesdad` for each data point in the test dataset. The required columns are:\n- `id` (unique identifier for each data point)\n- `NObeyesdad` (predicted obesity level)\n\nExample format:\n```csv\nid,NObeyesdad\n20758,Obesity_Type_II\n20759,Normal_Weight\n20760,Obesity_Type_III\n...\n```\n\nIn this phase, you have `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Conduct thorough statistical analysis on the cleaned data.\n2. Explore relationships between features and the target variable.\n3. Identify potential feature interactions.\n4. Visualize key insights and patterns.\n5. Provide recommendations for Feature Engineering.\n\n\n#############\n# NOTE #\n## PLANNING GUIDELINES ##\n1. Limit the plan to a MAXIMUM of FOUR tasks.\n2. Provide clear methods and constraints for each task.\n3. Focus on critical steps specific to the current phase.\n4. Prioritize methods and values mentioned in USER RULES.\n5. Offer detailed plans without writing actual code.\n6. ONLY focus on tasks relevant to this phase, avoiding those belonging to other phases. For example, during the in-depth EDA phase:\n    - you CAN perform detailed univariate analysis on KEY features.\n    - you CAN NOT modify any feature or modify data.\n\n## DATA OUTPUT PREFERENCES ##\n1. Prioritize TEXT format (print) for statistical information.\n2. Print a description before outputting statistics.\n3. Generate images only if text description is inadequate.\n\n## METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS ##\n1. Provide highly detailed methods, especially for data cleaning.\n2. Specify actions for each feature without omissions.\n\n## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ##\n1. Consider runtime and efficiency, particularly for:\n   - Data visualization\n   - Large dataset handling\n   - Complex algorithms\n2. Limit generated images to a MAXIMUM of 10 for EDA.\n3. Focus on critical visualizations with valuable insights.\n\n## OPTIMIZATION EXAMPLE ##\nWhen using seaborn or matplotlib for large datasets:\n- Turn off unnecessary details (e.g., annot=False in heatmaps)\n- Prioritize efficiency in plot generation\n\n#############\n# TASK #\n\nPlease design plan that is clear and specific to each FEATURE for the current development phase: In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis. \nThe developer will execute tasks based on your plan. \nI will provide you with INFORMATION, RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, and previous reports and plans.\nYou can use the following reasoning pattern to design the plan:\n1. Break down the task into smaller steps.\n2. For each step, ask yourself and answer:\n    - \"What is the objective of this step?\"\n    - \"What are the essential actions to achieve the objective?\"\n    - \"What features are involved in each action?\"\n    - \"Which tool can be used for each action? What are the parameters of the tool?\"\n    - \"What are the expected output of each action? What is the impact of the action on the data?\"\n    - \"What are the constraints of this step?\"\n\n\n#############\n# RESPONSE #\nLet's work this out in a step by step way.\n\n#############\n# START PLANNING #\nBefore you begin, please request the following documents from me, which contain important information that will guide your planning:\n1. Report and plan from the previous phase\n2. Available tools in this phase\n3. Sample data for analysis\n"
