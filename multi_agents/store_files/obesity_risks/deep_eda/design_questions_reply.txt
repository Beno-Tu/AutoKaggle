Based on the provided information and plan for the In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis phase, here are six key questions designed to summarize findings and provide guidance for the next phase of Feature Engineering:

### Key Questions

1. **What statistical characteristics were observed for each numerical feature, and how might these influence feature engineering decisions?**
   - **Purpose:** This question seeks to summarize the univariate analysis of numerical features, helping identify significant properties (e.g., skewness, central tendency) that could inform transformations or scaling in the next phase.

2. **What are the relationships between categorical features and the target variable (`NObeyesdad`), and which features show the strongest associations?**
   - **Purpose:** Understanding these relationships will assist in determining which categorical features may require encoding or interaction terms to enhance predictive power during feature engineering.

3. **What correlations were found among the numerical features and the target variable, and how can these correlations guide the creation of new features?**
   - **Purpose:** This question focuses on the correlation analysis results, highlighting potential linear relationships that could inform the creation of derived features or highlight multicollinearity concerns.

4. **What interactions between features (both numerical and categorical) were identified, and how can these interactions be leveraged in feature engineering?**
   - **Purpose:** Identifying interactions helps in understanding how multiple features combined may affect the target variable, guiding the development of interaction terms or composite features.

5. **What were the results of the chi-square tests for categorical features in relation to the target variable, and which features were found to be significantly dependent?**
   - **Purpose:** This question summarizes the outcomes of the chi-square tests, indicating which categorical features warrant further exploration as potential predictors or transformations.

6. **What key insights and patterns emerged from the visualizations, and how can these insights shape the feature engineering strategy?**
   - **Purpose:** This question encourages reflection on the overall visualizations, serving as a basis for identifying important features, potential transformations, or combinations that could enhance the model's performance in the next phase.

These questions aim to encapsulate the findings from the In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis phase while directing attention to the critical aspects necessary for effective feature engineering.
