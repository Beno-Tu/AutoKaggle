The required columns are:\n- `id` (unique identifier for each data point)\n- `NObeyesdad` (predicted obesity level)\n\nExample format:\n```csv\nid,NObeyesdad\n20758,Obesity_Type_II\n20759,Normal_Weight\n20760,Obesity_Type_III\n...\n```\n    </background_info>\n</INPUT>\n<EXECUTION RESULT>\n## PLAN\n\n### STEP 1\nTask: Conduct Thorough Statistical Analysis on the Cleaned Data\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Univariate Analysis on Numerical Features:**\n  - Tools: Pandas, seaborn/matplotlib\n  - Features: `Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, `FCVC`, `NCP`, `CH2O`, `FAF`, `TUE`\n  - Methods: Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, and range; plot histograms and box plots.\n- **Univariate Analysis on Categorical Features:**\n  - Tools: Pandas, seaborn/matplotlib\n  - Features: `Gender`, `family_history_with_overweight`, `FAVC`, `CAEC`, `SMOKE`, `SCC`, `CALC`, `MTRANS`\n  - Methods: Calculate frequency counts; plot bar charts.\n- **Target Variable Analysis:**\n  - Tools: Pandas, seaborn/matplotlib\n  - Features: `NObeyesdad`\n  - Methods: Calculate frequency counts; plot a bar chart.\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- Summary statistics and visual distributions for each numerical feature.\n- Frequency tables and bar charts for each categorical feature.\n- Frequency table and bar chart for the target variable.\nConstraints:\n- Ensure efficient calculation and plotting to handle large datasets.\n\n### STEP 2\nTask: Explore Relationships Between Features and the Target Variable\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Bivariate Analysis:**\n  - Tools: seaborn/matplotlib\n  - Features: All features against `NObeyesdad`\n  - Methods: Plot box plots for numerical features against the target variable; plot bar charts for categorical features against the target variable.\n- **Correlation Analysis:**\n  - Tools: Pandas, seaborn\n  - Features: Numerical features and the encoded target variable.\n  - Methods: Encode `NObeyesdad` into numerical values; calculate the correlation matrix; plot a heatmap of the correlation matrix.\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- Box plots and bar charts showing relationships between each feature and the target variable.\n- Correlation matrix and heatmap.\nConstraints:\n- Ensure accurate encoding of the target variable for correlation analysis.\n\n### STEP 3\nTask: Identify Potential Feature Interactions\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Pairwise Feature Interaction Analysis:**\n  - Tools: seaborn\n  - Features: All numerical and categorical features.\n  - Methods: Use pairplot function for numerical features; use heatmap function for categorical features (using one-hot encoding if necessary).\n- **Chi-Square Test for Categorical Features:**\n  - Tools: Scipy\n  - Features: All categorical features and the target variable.\n  - Methods: Perform the chi-square test using chi2_contingency function.\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- Pairwise scatter plots and heatmaps showing potential interactions.\n- Chi-square test results indicating which categorical features are dependent on the target variable.\nConstraints:\n- Limit the number of generated images to a maximum of 10 for critical insights.\n\n### STEP 4\nTask: Visualize Key Insights and Patterns\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Key Visualizations:**\n  - Tools: seaborn/matplotlib\n  - Features: All key features and the target variable.\n  - Methods: Create concise and informative visualizations (limit to 10 key plots).\n- **Summary of Findings:**\n  - Tools: Jupyter notebook, text report\n  - Features: All features and the target variable.\n  - Methods: Compile and describe the findings.\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- A set of up to 10 key plots (e.g., histograms, bar charts, box plots, heatmaps) that highlight critical insights.\n- A comprehensive summary report detailing the key insights and patterns identified during the EDA phase.\nConstraints:\n- Prioritize visualizations and analysis that provide valuable insights for subsequent feature engineering and model building phases.\n- Output statistical information in text format where possible, with descriptions preceding the statistics.\n</EXECUTION RESULT>\n\n"
