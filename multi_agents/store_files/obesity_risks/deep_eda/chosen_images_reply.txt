To select the most relevant images for the "In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis" phase, I will focus on images that provide insights into the relationships between variables, distributions, and potential patterns that could inform feature engineering and model building in the next phase.

Here are the chosen images:

1. **barchart_CAEC_vs_NObeyesdad.png** - Helps understand how the variable CAEC relates to obesity status.
2. **barchart_CALC_vs_NObeyesdad.png** - Shows the relationship of CALC with obesity, useful for feature relevance.
3. **barchart_FAVC_vs_NObeyesdad.png** - Analyzes the impact of FAVC on obesity, which is crucial for understanding dietary behavior.
4. **barchart_Gender_vs_NObeyesdad.png** - Examines gender differences in obesity, an important demographic factor.
5. **barchart_MTRANS_vs_NObeyesdad.png** - Investigates how mode of transportation relates to obesity, providing insights into lifestyle factors.
6. **boxplot_Age_vs_NObeyesdad.png** - Visualizes the distribution of age with respect to obesity, useful for understanding age demographics.
7. **correlation_matrix.png** - Gives an overview of correlations between numerical features, crucial for feature selection.
8. **pairplot_numerical_features.png** - Provides a visual representation of relationships between all numerical features, helping identify patterns.

Now, I'll format this selection in the specified JSON format.
