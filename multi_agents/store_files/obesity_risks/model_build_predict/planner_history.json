The features include:\n\n- **Demographic Information:**\n  - `Gender`: Categorical, values include `male` and `female`.\n  - `Age`: Numerical, standardized.\n  - `Age_Category`: Categorical, includes categories like `Young_Adult`, `Youth`, etc.\n\n- **Physical Measurements:**\n  - `Height`: Numerical, standardized.\n  - `Weight`: Numerical, standardized.\n  - `BMI`: Numerical, calculated from height and weight.\n\n- **Family History and Lifestyle:**\n  - `family_history_with_overweight`: Categorical, `yes` or `no`.\n  - `FAVC` (Frequent consumption of high caloric food): Categorical, `yes` or `no`.\n  - `FCVC` (Frequency of consumption of vegetables): Numerical, standardized.\n  - `NCP` (Number of main meals): Numerical, standardized.\n  - `CAEC` (Consumption of food between meals): Categorical, includes `always`, `frequently`, `no`, `sometimes`.\n  - `SMOKE`: Categorical, `yes` or `no`.\n  - `CH2O` (Daily water intake): Numerical, standardized.\n  - `SCC` (Calories tracking): Categorical, `yes` or `no`.\n  - `FAF` (Physical activity frequency): Numerical, standardized.\n  - `TUE` (Time using technology devices): Numerical, standardized.\n  - `CALC` (Alcohol consumption frequency): Categorical, includes `always`, `frequently`, `no`, `sometimes`.\n  - `MTRANS` (Transportation means): Categorical, includes `automobile`, `bike`, `motorbike`, `public_transportation`, `walking`.\n\n- **Encoded Features:**\n  - Binary encoded features for several categorical variables such as `Gender_female`, `Gender_male`, `family_history_with_overweight_encoded`, etc.\n\nNotable patterns and distributions:\n- The dataset appears to have been standardized, as indicated by the numerical values.\n- The categorical variables have been one-hot encoded for easier model training.\n- The feature `BMI` is derived from `Height` and `Weight`, indicating their direct relationship.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **`NObeyesdad`**: The target variable representing the obesity levels of individuals. Categories include:\n  - `Insufficient_Weight`\n  - `Normal_Weight`\n  - `Overweight_Level_I`\n  - `Overweight_Level_II`\n  - `Obesity_Type_I`\n  - `Obesity_Type_II`\n  - `Obesity_Type_III`\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should include:\n- `id`: Unique identifier for each data point.\n- `NObeyesdad`: Predicted obesity level for the corresponding `id`.\n\nExample:\n```plaintext\nid,NObeyesdad\n20758,Normal_Weight\n20759,Normal_Weight\n20760,Normal_Weight\n20761,Normal_Weight\n20762,Normal_Weight\n20763,Normal_Weight\n20764,Normal_Weight\n20765,Normal_Weight\n20766,Normal_Weight\n20767,Normal_Weight\n```\n\nIn this phase, you have `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`. You should first train a model on the training set and then make predictions on the test set.\nBefore training the model:\n1. For the training set, separate the target column as y.\n2. Remove the target column and any non-numeric columns (e.g., String-type columns) that cannot be used in model training from the training set.\nBefore making predictions:\n1. For the test set, remove the same columns that were removed from the training set (except the target column, which is not present in the test set).\n2. Ensure consistency between the columns used in training and prediction.\nDue to computational resource limitations, you are allowed to train a maximum of **three** models\n\n#############\n# NOTE #\n## PLANNING GUIDELINES ##\n1. Limit the plan to a MAXIMUM of FOUR tasks.\n2. Provide clear methods and constraints for each task.\n3. Focus on critical steps specific to the current phase.\n4. Prioritize methods and values mentioned in USER RULES.\n5. Offer detailed plans without writing actual code.\n6. ONLY focus on tasks relevant to this phase, avoiding those belonging to other phases. For example, during the in-depth EDA phase:\n    - you CAN perform detailed univariate analysis on KEY features.\n    - you CAN NOT modify any feature or modify data.\n\n## DATA OUTPUT PREFERENCES ##\n1. Prioritize TEXT format (print) for statistical information.\n2. Print a description before outputting statistics.\n3. Generate images only if text description is inadequate.\n\n## METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS ##\n1. Provide highly detailed methods, especially for data cleaning.\n2.

Which files were generated? Answer with detailed file path.\n### Answer 1\n- **Processed Files:**\n  - **Input Files:**\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/cleaned_train.csv`\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/cleaned_test.csv`\n  - **Output Files:**\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/processed_train.csv`\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/processed_test.csv`\n\n### Question 2\nWhich features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations.\n### Answer 2\n- **Features Involved:**\n  - **New Features Created:**\n    - `BMI`: Calculated as `Weight / (Height^2)`.\n    - `Age_Category`: Categorized into bins (`Youth`, `Young_Adult`, `Middle_Aged`, `Senior`, `Elderly`).\n    - `FAF_TUE_Interaction`: Interaction feature created by multiplying `FAF` and `TUE`.\n    - `FCVC_Category`: Binned into categories (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Very_High`).\n    - `NCP_Category`: Binned into categories (`Very_Low`, `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Very_High`).\n    \n  - **Feature Types Modified:**\n    - Numerical features `FCVC` and `NCP` were transformed into categorical features through binning.\n\n### Question 3\nWhat new features were created during this phase, and how do they enhance the dataset?\n### Answer 3\n- **New Features Created:**\n  - **BMI**: Provides a quantitative measure of body weight relative to height, which is a common indicator in obesity studies.\n  - **Age_Category**: Simplifies age representation into meaningful groups, making it easier for models to learn patterns related to age.\n  - **FAF_TUE_Interaction**: Captures the interaction between physical activity and technology use, potentially revealing how these factors together influence obesity.\n  - **FCVC_Category** & **NCP_Category**: These categorical features simplify the understanding of frequency-related behaviors, enhancing interpretability and model performance.\n\n### Question 4\nWhat transformations were applied to existing features, and what are the implications of these transformations?\n### Answer 4\n- **Transformations Applied:**\n  - **Binning of `FCVC` and `NCP`:** \n    - Converted continuous numerical values into discrete categories. This transformation can reduce noise and make the data more interpretable, but care must be taken to choose meaningful bin thresholds.\n    \n- **Implications:**\n  - These transformations can help the model perform better by reducing the complexity of the relationships, allowing it to focus on the categories rather than the raw numerical values.\n\n### Question 5\nHow were categorical variables handled, and what encoding techniques were used?\n### Answer 5\n- **Encoding Techniques Used:**\n  - **One-Hot Encoding:** Applied to `Gender`, `CAEC`, `CALC`, and `MTRANS`, which creates binary columns for each category, allowing models to interpret these variables without assuming any ordinal relationship.\n  - **Label Encoding:** Applied to `family_history_with_overweight`, `FAVC`, `SMOKE`, and `SCC`, converting these categorical variables into numerical format for models that can handle ordinal data.\n\n### Question 6\nWhat challenges or constraints were encountered during feature engineering, and how might they affect model building?\n### Answer 6\n- **Challenges and Constraints:**\n  - **Choosing Bins for Binning Features:** The thresholds for binning age, `FCVC`, and `NCP` need to be carefully considered to avoid losing important information and to ensure meaningful distinctions.\n  - **Dimensionality Increase:** One-hot encoding can lead to a significant increase in the number of features, which may introduce sparsity and increase the risk of overfitting.\n  - **Data Leakage Prevention:** Scaling must be applied after splitting into training and test sets to avoid leakage, ensuring that the model generalizes well.\n\n#############\n# TARGET VARIABLE #\n['NObeyesdad']\n#############\n# PROCESSED TRAIN DATA WITH FEATURES #\nid,Gender,Age,Height,Weight,family_history_with_overweight,FAVC,FCVC,NCP,CAEC,SMOKE,CH2O,SCC,FAF,TUE,CALC,MTRANS,NObeyesdad,BMI,Age_Category,FAF_TUE_Interaction,FCVC_Category,NCP_Category,Gender_female,Gender_male,CAEC_always,CAEC_frequently,CAEC_no,CAEC_sometimes,CALC_always,CALC_frequently,CALC_no,CALC_sometimes,MTRANS_automobile,MTRANS_bike,MTRANS_motorbike,MTRANS_public_transportation,MTRANS_walking,family_history_with_overweight_encoded,FAVC_encoded,SMOKE_encoded,SCC_encoded\n\n#############\n# PROCESSED TEST DATA WITH FEATURES #\nid,Gender,Age,Height,Weight,family_history_with_overweight,FAVC,FCVC,NCP,CAEC,SMOKE,CH2O,SCC,FAF,TUE,CALC,MTRANS,BMI,Age_Category,FAF_TUE_Interaction,FCVC_Category,NCP_Category,Gender_female,Gender_male,CAEC_always,CAEC_frequently,CAEC_no,CAEC_sometimes,CALC_always,CALC_frequently,CALC_no,CALC_sometimes,MTRANS_automobile,MTRANS_bike,MTRANS_motorbike,MTRANS_public_transportation,MTRANS_walking,family_history_with_overweight_encoded,FAVC_encoded,SMOKE_encoded,SCC_encoded\n\n#############\n# SUBMISSION FORMAT #\nid,NObeyesdad\n\n#############\n# EVALUATION METRIC #\n# Evaluation Metric\nSubmissions are evaluated based on the **accuracy score**, measuring the proportion of correct predictions made by the model.\n# AVAILABLE TOOLS #\n## TOOL LIST ##\nYou have access to the following tools:\n['train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model']\n## ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ##\nYou can also use functions from public libraries such as:\n- Pandas\n- NumPy\n- Scikit-learn\n- etc.\n## DETAILED TOOL DESCRIPTIONS ##\n## train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model\n\n**Name:** train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model  \n**Description:** Automate model training, validation, selection, and hyperparameter tuning for various machine learning tasks, returning the best performing model and their performance metrics.  \n**Applicable Situations:** Model selection, hyperparameter tuning, automated machine learning workflows.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `X`:\n  -
