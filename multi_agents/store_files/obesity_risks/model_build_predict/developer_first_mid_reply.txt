Great, now that I have all the necessary information, let's analyze the previous experience and suggestions to identify what went wrong and how we can improve.

### Previous Experience Analysis

1. **Error Insight**:
   - The error message `could not convert string to float: 'yes'` indicates that there was an issue with the format of the input data. This suggests that some categorical data might not have been properly encoded or that some columns expected to be numerical were not correctly processed.

2. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Inconsistent Column Handling**: The column removal and transformation steps might not have been applied consistently between the training and test sets. This can lead to mismatches in the data structure.
   - **Incorrect Data Types**: Some columns may not have been converted to the appropriate data types before being passed to the model, leading to errors during model fitting.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Ensure Consistency in Data Preparation**:
   - Make sure the same columns are removed from both the training and test sets.
   - Validate that all categorical data have been properly encoded and that only numeric data are passed to the model.

2. **Check Data Types**:
   - Before training the model, verify that all columns in the DataFrame are of the correct data type (i.e., numerical).

3. **Use Clear Column Names**:
   - Ensure that the columns used in training and prediction stages are clearly defined and consistent between the training and test sets.

### Updated Plan

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure that all steps applied to the training set are mirrored on the test set.
   - Check and enforce the correct data types for all columns before model training.

2. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Use the `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` utility with the specified models.

3. **Model Validation**:
   - Perform cross-validation to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

4. **Prediction and Submission**:
   - Generate predictions on the test set and prepare the submission file.

### Implementation

Let's implement the solution based on the updated plan:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, cross_val_predict
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report

# Load the processed datasets
train_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/processed_train.csv'
test_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/processed_test.csv'

train = pd.read_csv(train_path)
test = pd.read_csv(test_path)

# Separate the target variable
y = train['NObeyesdad']
X_train = train.drop(columns=['NObeyesdad'])

# Remove non-numeric columns
cols_to_remove = ['id', 'Gender', 'Age_Category', 'FCVC_Category', 'NCP_Category']
X_train = X_train.drop(columns=cols_to_remove)
X_test = test.drop(columns=cols_to_remove)

# Ensure consistency between the training and test sets
X_test = X_test[X_train.columns]  # Ensure X_test has the same columns as X_train

# Check and enforce data types
X_train = X_train.apply(pd.to_numeric)
X_test = X_test.apply(pd.to_numeric)

print("Data Preparation Completed")
print(f"X_train shape: {X_train.shape}")
print(f"X_test shape: {X_test.shape}")
print(f"y shape: {y.shape}")

# Use the provided utility function to train and select the best model
selected_models = ["random forest", "XGBoost", "GradientBoosting"]
best_model = train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model(
    X=X_train, 
    y=y, 
    problem_type='multiclass', 
    selected_models=selected_models
)

print("Model Selection and Training Completed")
print(f"Best Model: {best_model}")

# Perform cross-validation and get predictions
scores = cross_val_score(best_model, X_train, y, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
print(f"Cross-Validation Accuracy Scores: {scores}")

y_pred = cross_val_predict(best_model, X_train, y, cv=5)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y, y_pred))

print("Model Validation Completed")

# Fit the best model to the entire training data
best_model.fit(X_train, y)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = best_model.predict(X_test)

# Prepare the submission file
submission = pd.DataFrame({'id': test['id'], 'NObeyesdad': predictions})
submission.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/submission.csv', index=False)

print("Prediction and Submission File Preparation Completed")
```

### Explanation

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Columns `['id', 'Gender', 'Age_Category', 'FCVC_Category', 'NCP_Category']` are removed from both the training and test sets.
   - The target variable `NObeyesdad` is separated from the training set.
   - Ensured that the columns in `X_test` match those in `X_train`.
   - Converted all columns to numeric types to avoid data type issues.

2. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Utilized the `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` function with the specified models.

3. **Model Validation**:
   - Performed cross-validation to evaluate model performance using accuracy scores, confusion matrix, and classification report.

4. **Prediction and Submission**:
   - Generated predictions on the test set and prepared the submission file.

This approach should address the issues encountered in previous attempts and ensure a consistent and error-free model training and prediction process.
