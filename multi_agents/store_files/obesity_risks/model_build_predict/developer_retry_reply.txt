Great! Now that we have the code from the previous phase and all necessary details, we can proceed with implementing the complete solution for the `Model Building, Validation, and Prediction` phase.

We'll follow the plan and constraints provided:

### TASK 1: Data Preparation

**Thought Process:**
- Load the processed training and test datasets.
- Separate the target variable (`NObeyesdad`) from the training set.
- Remove the `id` and specified categorical columns from both training and test sets.

**Code:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the processed datasets
train_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/processed_train.csv'
test_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/processed_test.csv'

train = pd.read_csv(train_path)
test = pd.read_csv(test_path)

# Separate the target variable
y = train['NObeyesdad']
X_train = train.drop(columns=['NObeyesdad'])

# Remove non-numeric columns
cols_to_remove = ['id', 'Gender', 'Age_Category', 'FCVC_Category', 'NCP_Category']
X_train = X_train.drop(columns=cols_to_remove)
X_test = test.drop(columns=cols_to_remove)

# Ensure consistency between the training and test sets
X_test = X_test[X_train.columns]  # Ensure X_test has the same columns as X_train

print("Data Preparation Completed")
print(f"X_train shape: {X_train.shape}")
print(f"X_test shape: {X_test.shape}")
print(f"y shape: {y.shape}")
```

### TASK 2: Model Selection and Training

**Thought Process:**
- Use the provided utility function `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` to train and validate three models: RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, and XGBClassifier.
- This function will return the best performing model.

**Code:**

```python
# Use the provided utility function to train and select the best model
selected_models = ["random forest", "XGBoost", "GradientBoosting"]
best_model = train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model(
    X=X_train, 
    y=y, 
    problem_type='multiclass', 
    selected_models=selected_models
)

print("Model Selection and Training Completed")
print(f"Best Model: {best_model}")
```

### TASK 3: Model Validation

**Thought Process:**
- Evaluate the best model using cross-validation.
- Print the cross-validation scores, confusion matrix, and classification report.

**Code:**

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, cross_val_predict
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report

# Perform cross-validation and get predictions
scores = cross_val_score(best_model, X_train, y, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
print(f"Cross-Validation Accuracy Scores: {scores}")

y_pred = cross_val_predict(best_model, X_train, y, cv=5)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y, y_pred))

print("Model Validation Completed")
```

### TASK 4: Prediction and Submission File Preparation

**Thought Process:**
- Use the best model to make predictions on the test set.
- Prepare the submission file in the required format.

**Code:**

```python
# Fit the best model to the entire training data
best_model.fit(X_train, y)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = best_model.predict(X_test)

# Prepare the submission file
submission = pd.DataFrame({'id': test['id'], 'NObeyesdad': predictions})
submission.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/submission.csv', index=False)

print("Prediction and Submission File Preparation Completed")
```

### Summary

Here is the complete solution for the `Model Building, Validation, and Prediction` phase:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the processed datasets
train_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/processed_train.csv'
test_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/processed_test.csv'

train = pd.read_csv(train_path)
test = pd.read_csv(test_path)

# Separate the target variable
y = train['NObeyesdad']
X_train = train.drop(columns=['NObeyesdad'])

# Remove non-numeric columns
cols_to_remove = ['id', 'Gender', 'Age_Category', 'FCVC_Category', 'NCP_Category']
X_train = X_train.drop(columns=cols_to_remove)
X_test = test.drop(columns=cols_to_remove)

# Ensure consistency between the training and test sets
X_test = X_test[X_train.columns]  # Ensure X_test has the same columns as X_train

print("Data Preparation Completed")
print(f"X_train shape: {X_train.shape}")
print(f"X_test shape: {X_test.shape}")
print(f"y shape: {y.shape}")

# Use the provided utility function to train and select the best model
selected_models = ["random forest", "XGBoost", "GradientBoosting"]
best_model = train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model(
    X=X_train, 
    y=y, 
    problem_type='multiclass', 
    selected_models=selected_models
)

print("Model Selection and Training Completed")
print(f"Best Model: {best_model}")

from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, cross_val_predict
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report

# Perform cross-validation and get predictions
scores = cross_val_score(best_model, X_train, y, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
print(f"Cross-Validation Accuracy Scores: {scores}")

y_pred = cross_val_predict(best_model, X_train, y, cv=5)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y, y_pred))

print("Model Validation Completed")

# Fit the best model to the entire training data
best_model.fit(X_train, y)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = best_model.predict(X_test)

# Prepare the submission file
submission = pd.DataFrame({'id': test['id'], 'NObeyesdad': predictions})
submission.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/submission.csv', index=False)

print("Prediction and Submission File Preparation Completed")
```

This code will handle the entire process from data preparation to making predictions and preparing the submission file.
