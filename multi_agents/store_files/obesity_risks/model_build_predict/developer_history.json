Data Loading:\n   - Always load data files from the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/` directory.\n   - Use specific files for each phase:\n     - Data Cleaning: `train.csv` and `test.csv`\n     - Feature Engineering: `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`\n     - Model Building, Validation, and Prediction: `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`\n\n2. Data Saving:\n   - Save image files in the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/model_build_predict/images/` directory.\n   - Save data files in the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/` directory.\n   - Use clear, meaningful names for image files that reflect their content.\n   - Do NOT use special characters like `/` or spaces in file names.\n   - Save specific files for each phase:\n     - Data Cleaning: `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`\n     - Feature Engineering: `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`\n\n3. Data Processing:\n   - Always work on a copy of the DataFrame, not the original.\n   - Ensure correct data types for all columns before any operations.\n   - Apply consistent modifications (e.g., scaling, encoding) to both training and test sets.\n   - Take care with target-dependent operations on the test set, which lacks the target variable.\n   - Do NOT modify Id-type columns.\n\n## CODING PRACTICES ##\n1. General Rules:\n   - Use `print()` for outputting values.\n   - Avoid writing `assert` statements.\n\n2. Visualization:\n   - Use `plt.close()` after saving each image.\n   - Limit EDA visualizations to 10 or fewer, focusing on the most insightful.\n   - Optimize for large datasets (e.g., `annot=False` in seaborn heatmaps).\n\n3. Efficiency:\n   - Prioritize runtime efficiency, especially for:\n     - Data visualization\n     - Large dataset handling\n     - Complex algorithms\n\n## EXAMPLES ##\n- Before calculating a correlation matrix, ensure all data is numerical. Handle non-numerical data appropriately.\n- Verify consistent data types across columns before merging or joining operations.\n\nRemember: Always consider resource constraints and prioritize efficiency in your code.\n"

The notable features include:\n- **Gender**: Categorical, indicating whether the individual is male or female.\n- **Age**: Numerical, representing the age of the individual in a normalized form.\n- **Height and Weight**: Numerical, representing the physical dimensions of the individual in normalized forms.\n- **BMI**: Numerical, derived from height and weight, indicating the body mass index in a normalized form.\n- **Lifestyle habits**: Including frequency of vegetable consumption (`FCVC`), number of main meals (`NCP`), daily water intake (`CH2O`), physical activity frequency (`FAF`), and time using technology (`TUE`).\n- **Behavioral factors**: Such as family history with overweight, consumption of high caloric food (`FAVC`), smoking status (`SMOKE`), alcohol consumption (`CALC`), and mode of transportation (`MTRANS`).\n- **Health monitoring**: Whether the individual monitors their caloric intake (`SCC`).\n\nThe dataset has been pre-processed with numerical features normalized and categorical features encoded into binary dummy variables. Interaction terms between certain lifestyle factors are also included.\n\n## Target Variable\n- `NObeyesdad`: The target variable representing different levels of obesity, including categories such as `Insufficient_Weight`, `Normal_Weight`, `Overweight_Level_I`, `Overweight_Level_II`, `Obesity_Type_I`, `Obesity_Type_II`, and `Obesity_Type_III`.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should contain the following columns:\n- `id`: Unique identifier for each test data point.\n- `NObeyesdad`: The predicted obesity level for the corresponding id.\n\nIn this phase, you have `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`. You should first train a model on the training set and then make predictions on the test set.\nBefore training the model:\n1. For the training set, separate the target column as y.\n2. Remove the target column and any non-numeric columns (e.g., String-type columns) that cannot be used in model training from the training set.\nBefore making predictions:\n1. For the test set, remove the same columns that were removed from the training set (except the target column, which is not present in the test set).\n2. Ensure consistency between the columns used in training and prediction.\nDue to computational resource limitations, you are allowed to train a maximum of **three** models\n\n#############\n# PLAN #\n## PLAN\n\n### STEP 1\nTask: Data Preparation\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tool:** pandas\n- **Parameters:**\n  ```python\n  y = train['NObeyesdad']\n  X_train = train.drop(columns=['NObeyesdad'])\n  X_train = X_train.drop(columns=['id', 'Gender', 'Age_Category', 'FCVC_Category', 'NCP_Category'])\n  X_test = test.drop(columns=['id', 'Gender', 'Age_Category', 'FCVC_Category', 'NCP_Category'])\n  ```\n- **Involved Features:** All features except `id`, `Gender`, `Age_Category`, `FCVC_Category`, `NCP_Category`, and `NObeyesdad`\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- `y` containing the target variable\n- `X_train` with only numeric predictors\n- `X_test` with the same structure as `X_train`\n\nConstraints:\n- Ensure that all transformations applied to the training set are identically applied to the test set.\n\n### STEP 2\nTask: Model Selection and Training\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tool:** `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model`\n- **Models to Consider:** RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, XGBClassifier\n- **Parameters:**\n  ```python\n  selected_models = [\"random forest\", \"XGBoost\", \"GradientBoosting\"]\n  best_model = train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model(\n      X=X_train, \n      y=y, \n      problem_type='multiclass', \n      selected_models=selected_models\n  )\n  ```\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- Trained models ready for validation\n- The best performing trained model\n\nConstraints:\n- Limit to three models due to resource limitations.\n- Choose models known for handling categorical data and multiclass classification efficiently.\n\n### STEP 3\nTask: Model Validation\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tool:** scikit-learn\n- **Parameters:**\n  ```python\n  from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, cross_val_predict\n  from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report\n\n  scores = cross_val_score(best_model, X_train, y, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')\n  print(f\"Cross-Validation Accuracy Scores: {scores}\")\n\n  y_pred = cross_val_predict(best_model, X_train, y, cv=5)\n  print(\"Confusion Matrix:\\n\", confusion_matrix(y, y_pred))\n  print(\"Classification Report:\\n\", classification_report(y, y_pred))\n  ```\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- Cross-validation scores for each model\n- Detailed performance metrics for each model, including confusion matrix and classification report\n\nConstraints:\n- Use a consistent validation strategy (e.g., 5-fold cross-validation) to compare models fairly.\n\n### STEP 4\nTask: Prediction and Submission File Preparation\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tool:** scikit-learn, pandas\n- **Parameters:**\n  ```python\n  predictions = best_model.predict(X_test)\n  submission = pd.DataFrame({'id': test['id'], 'NObeyesdad': predictions})\n  submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)\n  ```\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- Array of predictions for the test set\n- CSV file in the required submission format\n\nConstraints:\n- Ensure the submission file adheres to the specified format with the correct columns and order.\n\n#############\n# TASK #\n\nDevelop an efficient solution based on the Planner's provided plan:\n1.

        "content": "Great, now that I have all the necessary information, let's analyze the previous experience and suggestions to identify what went wrong and how we can improve.\n\n### Previous Experience Analysis\n\n1. **Error Insight**:\n   - The error message `could not convert string to float: 'yes'` indicates that there was an issue with the format of the input data. This suggests that some categorical data might not have been properly encoded or that some columns expected to be numerical were not correctly processed.\n\n2. **Potential Issues**:\n   - **Inconsistent Column Handling**: The column removal and transformation steps might not have been applied consistently between the training and test sets. This can lead to mismatches in the data structure.\n   - **Incorrect Data Types**: Some columns may not have been converted to the appropriate data types before being passed to the model, leading to errors during model fitting.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **Ensure Consistency in Data Preparation**:\n   - Make sure the same columns are removed from both the training and test sets.\n   - Validate that all categorical data have been properly encoded and that only numeric data are passed to the model.\n\n2. **Check Data Types**:\n   - Before training the model, verify that all columns in the DataFrame are of the correct data type (i.e., numerical).\n\n3. **Use Clear Column Names**:\n   - Ensure that the columns used in training and prediction stages are clearly defined and consistent between the training and test sets.\n\n### Updated Plan\n\n1. **Data Preparation**:\n   - Ensure that all steps applied to the training set are mirrored on the test set.\n   - Check and enforce the correct data types for all columns before model training.\n\n2. **Model Selection and Training**:\n   - Use the `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` utility with the specified models.\n\n3. **Model Validation**:\n   - Perform cross-validation to evaluate the model\u2019s performance.\n\n4. **Prediction and Submission**:\n   - Generate predictions on the test set and prepare the submission file.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement the solution based on the updated plan:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, cross_val_predict\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report\n\n# Load the processed datasets\ntrain_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/processed_train.csv'\ntest_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/processed_test.csv'\n\ntrain = pd.read_csv(train_path)\ntest = pd.read_csv(test_path)\n\n# Separate the target variable\ny = train['NObeyesdad']\nX_train = train.drop(columns=['NObeyesdad'])\n\n# Remove non-numeric columns\ncols_to_remove = ['id', 'Gender', 'Age_Category', 'FCVC_Category', 'NCP_Category']\nX_train = X_train.drop(columns=cols_to_remove)\nX_test = test.drop(columns=cols_to_remove)\n\n# Ensure consistency between the training and test sets\nX_test = X_test[X_train.columns]  # Ensure X_test has the same columns as X_train\n\n# Check and enforce data types\nX_train = X_train.apply(pd.to_numeric)\nX_test = X_test.apply(pd.to_numeric)\n\nprint(\"Data Preparation Completed\")\nprint(f\"X_train shape: {X_train.shape}\")\nprint(f\"X_test shape: {X_test.shape}\")\nprint(f\"y shape: {y.shape}\")\n\n# Use the provided utility function to train and select the best model\nselected_models = [\"random forest\", \"XGBoost\", \"GradientBoosting\"]\nbest_model = train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model(\n    X=X_train, \n    y=y, \n    problem_type='multiclass', \n    selected_models=selected_models\n)\n\nprint(\"Model Selection and Training Completed\")\nprint(f\"Best Model: {best_model}\")\n\n# Perform cross-validation and get predictions\nscores = cross_val_score(best_model, X_train, y, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')\nprint(f\"Cross-Validation Accuracy Scores: {scores}\")\n\ny_pred = cross_val_predict(best_model, X_train, y, cv=5)\nprint(\"Confusion Matrix:\\n\", confusion_matrix(y, y_pred))\nprint(\"Classification Report:\\n\", classification_report(y, y_pred))\n\nprint(\"Model Validation Completed\")\n\n# Fit the best model to the entire training data\nbest_model.fit(X_train, y)\n\n# Make predictions on the test set\npredictions = best_model.predict(X_test)\n\n# Prepare the submission file\nsubmission = pd.DataFrame({'id': test['id'], 'NObeyesdad': predictions})\nsubmission.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/submission.csv', index=False)\n\nprint(\"Prediction and Submission File Preparation Completed\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Data Preparation**:\n   - Columns `['id', 'Gender', 'Age_Category', 'FCVC_Category', 'NCP_Category']` are removed from both the training and test sets.\n   - The target variable `NObeyesdad` is separated from the training set.\n   - Ensured that the columns in `X_test` match those in `X_train`.\n   - Converted all columns to numeric types to avoid data type issues.\n\n2. **Model Selection and Training**:\n   - Utilized the `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` function with the specified models.\n\n3. **Model Validation**:\n   - Performed cross-validation to evaluate model performance using accuracy scores, confusion matrix, and classification report.\n\n4. **Prediction and Submission**:\n   - Generated predictions on the test set and prepared the submission file.\n\nThis approach should address the issues encountered in previous attempts and ensure a consistent and error-free model training and prediction process."
