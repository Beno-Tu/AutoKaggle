Preliminary statistics generated for the training dataset included summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles) for numerical features such as `Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, `FCVC`, `NCP`, `CH2O`, `FAF`, and `TUE`. Additionally, frequency counts were obtained for categorical features including `Gender`, `family_history_with_overweight`, `FAVC`, `CAEC`, `SMOKE`, `SCC`, `CALC`, and `MTRANS`.\n\n### Question 2\nWhich features exhibited missing values, and what were their respective proportions?\n### Answer 2\nMissing values were identified in various features, although specific proportions were not detailed in the summary. The output indicated which features had missing values, and recommendations for addressing these values will be made in the Data Cleaning phase.\n\n### Question 3\nWhat outliers were identified in the numerical features, and which features were most affected?\n### Answer 3\nOutliers were identified through the generation of boxplots for numerical features. Features such as `Age`, `Height`, and `Weight` typically exhibited the most significant outliers. However, specific outlier values were not provided in the summary.\n\n### Question 4\nWhat inconsistencies or anomalies were found in categorical features, particularly in their value distributions?\n### Answer 4\nInconsistencies were noted in the value distributions of categorical features. For example, the bar chart for `CAEC` indicated that \"Sometimes\" was the most frequently reported category. Additionally, a significant number of individuals reported having a family history of overweight as \"yes\", and a strong skew towards \"yes\" was observed in the `FAVC` category.\n\n### Question 5\nWere there any notable correlations or patterns observed among the features that could influence data cleaning decisions?\n### Answer 5\nNotable correlations were observed through a heatmap, which illustrated relationships among numerical features. Some features may have significant correlations, suggesting that further analysis is needed to guide data cleaning decisions, such as possible feature combination or removal.\n\n### Question 6\nWhat specific recommendations or actions should be taken in the Data Cleaning phase based on the findings from the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis?\n### Answer 6\n1. **Address Missing Values:** Identify features with missing values and decide on imputation or removal strategies.\n2. **Handle Outliers:** Consider capping or removal of outliers in numerical features based on boxplot analysis.\n3. **Standardize Categorical Values:** Ensure consistency in categorical features to avoid anomalies (e.g., \"yes\" vs. \"Yes\").\n4. **Investigate Correlations:** Further analyze correlated features to determine if any should be combined or removed.\n5. **Explore Distributions:** Consider stratifying data based on categorical distributions (like `family_history_with_overweight`) for targeted cleaning.\n\n#############\n# TARGET VARIABLE #\n['NObeyesdad']\n#############\n# TRAIN DATA WITH FEATURES #\nid,Gender,Age,Height,Weight,family_history_with_overweight,FAVC,FCVC,NCP,CAEC,SMOKE,CH2O,SCC,FAF,TUE,CALC,MTRANS,NObeyesdad\n\n#############\n# TEST DATA WITH FEATURES #\nid,Gender,Age,Height,Weight,family_history_with_overweight,FAVC,FCVC,NCP,CAEC,SMOKE,CH2O,SCC,FAF,TUE,CALC,MTRANS\n\n# AVAILABLE TOOLS #\n## TOOL LIST ##\nYou have access to the following tools:\n['fill_missing_values', 'remove_columns_with_missing_data', 'detect_and_handle_outliers_zscore', 'detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr', 'convert_data_types', 'remove_duplicates', 'format_datetime']\n## ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ##\nYou can also use functions from public libraries such as:\n- Pandas\n- NumPy\n- Scikit-learn\n- etc.\n## DETAILED TOOL DESCRIPTIONS ##\n## fill_missing_values\n\n**Name:** fill_missing_values  \n**Description:** Fill missing values in specified columns of a DataFrame.

Data Loading:\n   - Always load data files from the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/` directory.\n   - Use specific files for each phase:\n     - Data Cleaning: `train.csv` and `test.csv`\n     - Feature Engineering: `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`\n     - Model Building, Validation, and Prediction: `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`\n\n2. Data Saving:\n   - Save image files in the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/data_cleaning/images/` directory.\n   - Save data files in the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/` directory.\n   - Use clear, meaningful names for image files that reflect their content.\n   - Do NOT use special characters like `/` or spaces in file names.\n   - Save specific files for each phase:\n     - Data Cleaning: `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`\n     - Feature Engineering: `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`\n\n3. Data Processing:\n   - Always work on a copy of the DataFrame, not the original.\n   - Ensure correct data types for all columns before any operations.\n   - Apply consistent modifications (e.g., scaling, encoding) to both training and test sets.\n   - Take care with target-dependent operations on the test set, which lacks the target variable.\n   - Do NOT modify Id-type columns.\n\n## CODING PRACTICES ##\n1. General Rules:\n   - Use `print()` for outputting values.\n   - Avoid writing `assert` statements.\n\n2. Visualization:\n   - Use `plt.close()` after saving each image.\n   - Limit EDA visualizations to 10 or fewer, focusing on the most insightful.\n   - Optimize for large datasets (e.g., `annot=False` in seaborn heatmaps).\n\n3. Efficiency:\n   - Prioritize runtime efficiency, especially for:\n     - Data visualization\n     - Large dataset handling\n     - Complex algorithms\n\n## EXAMPLES ##\n- Before calculating a correlation matrix, ensure all data is numerical. Handle non-numerical data appropriately.\n- Verify consistent data types across columns before merging or joining operations.\n\nRemember: Always consider resource constraints and prioritize efficiency in your code.\n"

With the provided tools and data information, I'll implement the data cleaning steps according to the plan. Let's go through each task step-by-step.\n\n### TASK 1: Address Missing Values\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will fill missing values in numerical features using the mean and in categorical features using the mode. This is a common practice to handle missing data without introducing much bias.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the data\ntrain_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/train.csv'\ntest_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/test.csv'\n\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv(train_path)\ntest_df = pd.read_csv(test_path)\n\n# Define numerical and categorical features\nnumerical_features = ['Age', 'Height', 'Weight', 'FCVC', 'NCP', 'CH2O', 'FAF', 'TUE']\ncategorical_features = ['Gender', 'family_history_with_overweight', 'FAVC', 'CAEC', 'SMOKE', 'SCC', 'CALC', 'MTRANS']\n\n# Fill missing values in numerical features\ntrain_df = fill_missing_values(train_df, numerical_features, method='mean')\ntest_df = fill_missing_values(test_df, numerical_features, method='mean')\n\n# Fill missing values in categorical features\ntrain_df = fill_missing_values(train_df, categorical_features, method='mode')\ntest_df = fill_missing_values(test_df, categorical_features, method='mode')\n```\n\n### TASK 2: Handle Outliers\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will handle outliers in numerical features using the IQR method with a factor of 1.5. Outliers will be clipped to reduce their impact on the model.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\n# Handle outliers in numerical features using IQR method\ntrain_df = detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr(train_df, numerical_features, factor=1.5, method='clip')\ntest_df = detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr(test_df, numerical_features, factor=1.5, method='clip')\n```\n\n### TASK 3: Ensure Data Consistency\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will convert categorical values to lowercase and ensure correct data types for all columns to maintain consistency across the dataset.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\n# Convert categorical features to lowercase\nfor feature in categorical_features:\n    train_df[feature] = train_df[feature].str.lower()\n    test_df[feature] = test_df[feature].str.lower()\n\n# Convert data types for numerical features and 'id' column\ntrain_df = convert_data_types(train_df, numerical_features, target_type='float')\ntest_df = convert_data_types(test_df, numerical_features, target_type='float')\n\ntrain_df = convert_data_types(train_df, 'id', target_type='int')\ntest_df = convert_data_types(test_df, 'id', target_type='int')\n```\n\n### TASK 4: Remove Duplicates\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will remove duplicate rows from the dataset to ensure each entry is unique.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\n# Remove duplicates from the dataset\ntrain_df = remove_duplicates(train_df, keep='first')\ntest_df = remove_duplicates(test_df, keep='first')\n```\n\n### Save Cleaned Data\n\n#### Code:\n```python\n# Save the cleaned datasets\ncleaned_train_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/cleaned_train.csv'\ncleaned_test_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/cleaned_test.csv'\n\ntrain_df.to_csv(cleaned_train_path, index=False)\ntest_df.to_csv(cleaned_test_path, index=False)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Step 1: Address Missing Values**\n   - Loaded the data from the specified paths.\n   - Filled missing values in numerical features using the mean and in categorical features using the mode.\n\n2. **Step 2: Handle Outliers**\n   - Handled outliers in numerical features using the IQR method and clipped them to reduce their impact.\n\n3. **Step 3: Ensure Data Consistency**\n   - Converted categorical values to lowercase for consistency.\n   - Ensured correct data types for numerical features and the 'id' column.\n\n4. **Step 4: Remove Duplicates**\n   - Removed duplicate rows to maintain unique entries in the dataset.\n\n5. **Save Cleaned Data**\n   - Saved the cleaned train and test datasets to the specified paths.\n\nThis concludes the data cleaning phase. The cleaned datasets are now ready for the next phase: In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis.\n</EXECUTION RESULT>\n\n"
