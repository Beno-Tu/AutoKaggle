With the provided tools and data information, I'll implement the data cleaning steps according to the plan. Let's go through each task step-by-step.\n\n### TASK 1: Address Missing Values\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will fill missing values in numerical features using the mean and in categorical features using the mode. This is a common practice to handle missing data without introducing much bias.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the data\ntrain_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/train.csv'\ntest_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/test.csv'\n\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv(train_path)\ntest_df = pd.read_csv(test_path)\n\n# Define numerical and categorical features\nnumerical_features = ['Age', 'Height', 'Weight', 'FCVC', 'NCP', 'CH2O', 'FAF', 'TUE']\ncategorical_features = ['Gender', 'family_history_with_overweight', 'FAVC', 'CAEC', 'SMOKE', 'SCC', 'CALC', 'MTRANS']\n\n# Fill missing values in numerical features\ntrain_df = fill_missing_values(train_df, numerical_features, method='mean')\ntest_df = fill_missing_values(test_df, numerical_features, method='mean')\n\n# Fill missing values in categorical features\ntrain_df = fill_missing_values(train_df, categorical_features, method='mode')\ntest_df = fill_missing_values(test_df, categorical_features, method='mode')\n```\n\n### TASK 2: Handle Outliers\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will handle outliers in numerical features using the IQR method with a factor of 1.5. Outliers will be clipped to reduce their impact on the model.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\n# Handle outliers in numerical features using IQR method\ntrain_df = detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr(train_df, numerical_features, factor=1.5, method='clip')\ntest_df = detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr(test_df, numerical_features, factor=1.5, method='clip')\n```\n\n### TASK 3: Ensure Data Consistency\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will convert categorical values to lowercase and ensure correct data types for all columns to maintain consistency across the dataset.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\n# Convert categorical features to lowercase\nfor feature in categorical_features:\n    train_df[feature] = train_df[feature].str.lower()\n    test_df[feature] = test_df[feature].str.lower()\n\n# Convert data types for numerical features and 'id' column\ntrain_df = convert_data_types(train_df, numerical_features, target_type='float')\ntest_df = convert_data_types(test_df, numerical_features, target_type='float')\n\ntrain_df = convert_data_types(train_df, 'id', target_type='int')\ntest_df = convert_data_types(test_df, 'id', target_type='int')\n```\n\n### TASK 4: Remove Duplicates\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will remove duplicate rows from the dataset to ensure each entry is unique.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\n# Remove duplicates from the dataset\ntrain_df = remove_duplicates(train_df, keep='first')\ntest_df = remove_duplicates(test_df, keep='first')\n```\n\n### Save Cleaned Data\n\n#### Code:\n```python\n# Save the cleaned datasets\ncleaned_train_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/cleaned_train.csv'\ncleaned_test_path = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/cleaned_test.csv'\n\ntrain_df.to_csv(cleaned_train_path, index=False)\ntest_df.to_csv(cleaned_test_path, index=False)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Step 1: Address Missing Values**\n   - Loaded the data from the specified paths.\n   - Filled missing values in numerical features using the mean and in categorical features using the mode.\n\n2. **Step 2: Handle Outliers**\n   - Handled outliers in numerical features using the IQR method and clipped them to reduce their impact.\n\n3. **Step 3: Ensure Data Consistency**\n   - Converted categorical values to lowercase for consistency.\n   - Ensured correct data types for numerical features and the 'id' column.\n\n4. **Step 4: Remove Duplicates**\n   - Removed duplicate rows to maintain unique entries in the dataset.\n\n5. **Save Cleaned Data**\n   - Saved the cleaned train and test datasets to the specified paths.\n\nThis concludes the data cleaning phase. The cleaned datasets are now ready for the next phase: In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis.\n</EXECUTION RESULT>\n\n"
