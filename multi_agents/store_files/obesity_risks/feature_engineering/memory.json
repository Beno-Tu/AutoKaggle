Understand Background\n2. Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis\n3. Data Cleaning\n4. In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis\n5. Feature Engineering\n6. Model Building, Validation, and Prediction\nCurrently, I am at phase: Feature Engineering.\n\n#############\n# INFORMATION #\nData preview:\n# Data Information\n\n## Data Type\n\n### ID type\n- `id`\n\n### Numerical type\n- `Age`\n- `Height`\n- `Weight`\n- `FCVC`\n- `NCP`\n- `CH2O`\n- `FAF`\n- `TUE`\n\n### Categorical type\n- `Gender`\n- `family_history_with_overweight`\n- `FAVC`\n- `CAEC`\n- `SMOKE`\n- `SCC`\n- `CALC`\n- `MTRANS`\n\n### Datetime type\n- None\n\n## Detailed data description\nThe provided data consists of several features related to individuals' demographic information, lifestyle habits, and health metrics. Below is a detailed description of the data:\n\n1. **Gender**: Categorical variable indicating the gender of the individual (`male` or `female`).\n2. **Age**: Numerical variable representing the age of the individual.\n3. **Height**: Numerical variable representing the height of the individual in meters.\n4. **Weight**: Numerical variable representing the weight of the individual in kilograms.\n5. **family_history_with_overweight**: Categorical variable indicating whether the individual has a family history of being overweight (`yes` or `no`).\n6. **FAVC**: Categorical variable indicating if the individual frequently consumes high-calorie food (`yes` or `no`).\n7. **FCVC**: Numerical variable indicating the frequency of vegetable consumption.\n8. **NCP**: Numerical variable indicating the number of main meals per day.\n9. **CAEC**: Categorical variable indicating the frequency of food consumption between meals (`no`, `sometimes`, `frequently`, `always`).\n10. **SMOKE**: Categorical variable indicating if the individual smokes (`yes` or `no`).\n11. **CH2O**: Numerical variable indicating the daily water intake in liters.\n12. **SCC**: Categorical variable indicating if the individual monitors their calorie intake (`yes` or `no`).\n13. **FAF**: Numerical variable indicating the frequency of physical activity per week.\n14. **TUE**: Numerical variable indicating the time spent using technology devices daily.\n15. **CALC**: Categorical variable indicating the frequency of alcohol consumption (`no`, `sometimes`, `frequently`, `always`).\n16. **MTRANS**: Categorical variable indicating the primary mode of transportation (`automobile`, `public_transportation`, `walking`, `motorbike`, `bike`).\n\nThe cleaned train and test datasets contain these features with some variations in values, indicating diversity in the data. The train dataset includes a target variable while the test dataset does not.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **NObeyesdad**: The target variable represents the obesity level of the individual. It includes categories such as `Insufficient_Weight`, `Normal_Weight`, `Overweight_Level_I`, `Overweight_Level_II`, `Obesity_Type_I`, `Obesity_Type_II`, and `Obesity_Type_III`.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should contain the `id` and the predicted `NObeyesdad` for each individual in the test dataset. The format should be as follows:\n\n| id    | NObeyesdad            |\n|-------|------------------------|\n| 20758 | [Predicted Category]   |\n| 20759 | [Predicted Category]   |\n| ...   | ...                    |\n\nThe `id` column is a unique identifier for each individual, and the `NObeyesdad` column contains the predicted category of obesity level.\n\nIn this phase, you have `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Create new features based on insights from the In-depth EDA.\n2. Transform existing features to improve model performance.\n3. Handle categorical variables (e.g., encoding).\n4. Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.\n5. Select the most relevant features for modeling if necessary.\n6. Other necessary feature engineering steps.\n7. Create `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`.\nOutput: Processed datasets (processed_train.csv and processed_test.csv).\n\n#############\n# NOTE #\n## PLANNING GUIDELINES ##\n1. Limit the plan to a MAXIMUM of FOUR tasks.\n2. Provide clear methods and constraints for each task.\n3. Focus on critical steps specific to the current phase.\n4. Prioritize methods and values mentioned in USER RULES.\n5. Offer detailed plans without writing actual code.\n6. ONLY focus on tasks relevant to this phase, avoiding those belonging to other phases. For example, during the in-depth EDA phase:\n    - you CAN perform detailed univariate analysis on KEY features.\n    - you CAN NOT modify any feature or modify data.\n\n## DATA OUTPUT PREFERENCES ##\n1. Prioritize TEXT format (print) for statistical information.\n2. Print a description before outputting statistics.\n3. Generate images only if text description is inadequate.\n\n## METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS ##\n1. Provide highly detailed methods, especially for data cleaning.\n2. Specify actions for each feature without omissions.\n\n## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ##\n1. Consider runtime and efficiency, particularly for:\n   - Data visualization\n   - Large dataset handling\n   - Complex algorithms\n2. Limit generated images to a MAXIMUM of 10 for EDA.\n3. Focus on critical visualizations with valuable insights.\n\n## OPTIMIZATION EXAMPLE ##\nWhen using seaborn or matplotlib for large datasets:\n- Turn off unnecessary details (e.g., annot=False in heatmaps)\n- Prioritize efficiency in plot generation\n\n#############\n# TASK #\n\nPlease design plan that is clear and specific to each FEATURE for the current development phase: Feature Engineering. \nThe developer will execute tasks based on your plan. \nI will provide you with INFORMATION, RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, and previous reports and plans.\nYou can use the following reasoning pattern to design the plan:\n1. Break down the task into smaller steps.\n2.

What are the parameters of the tool?\"\n    - \"What are the expected output of each action? What is the impact of the action on the data?\"\n    - \"What are the constraints of this step?\"\n\n\n#############\n# RESPONSE #\nLet's work this out in a step by step way.\n\n#############\n# START PLANNING #\nBefore you begin, please request the following documents from me, which contain important information that will guide your planning:\n1.

What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations.\n### Answer 2\n- The features involved in this phase include:\n  - **Numerical Features**: Age, Height, Weight, FCVC, NCP, CH2O, FAF, TUE.\n  - **Categorical Features**: Gender, family_history_with_overweight, FAVC, CAEC, SMOKE, SCC, CALC, MTRANS.\n  - Target Variable: NObeyesdad.\n  \n- **Changes**:\n  - **Feature Creation**: Potential for creating BMI from Weight and Height.\n  - **Feature Modification**: Features like FCVC and NCP can be binned into categories for easier interpretation.\n  - **No Features Deleted**: All initial features were retained for further analysis.\n\n### Question 3\nWhat are the relationships between categorical features and the target variable (`NObeyesdad`), and which features show the strongest associations?\n### Answer 3\n- **Gender** shows a notable distribution across obesity categories, with females generally having lower obesity levels.\n- **Family history with overweight** indicates a trend towards higher obesity levels in individuals with such history.\n- **FAVC** (frequent consumption of high-caloric food) is strongly associated with higher obesity levels.\n- **CAEC** (food consumption between meals) shows a correlation where \"sometimes\" is linked to higher obesity.\n- **SMOKE** and **SCC** also appear to show differences, but FAVC and CAEC are particularly noteworthy for their strong associations.\n\n### Question 4\nWhat correlations were found among the numerical features and the target variable, and how can these correlations guide the creation of new features?\n### Answer 4\n- A correlation matrix highlights relationships; for example:\n  - Weight positively correlates with obesity levels.\n  - Age shows a slight positive correlation with obesity, suggesting older individuals may have higher obesity.\n- These correlations can guide the creation of features like BMI from weight and height or interaction terms between age and physical activity frequency.\n\n### Question 5\nWhat were the results of the chi-square tests for categorical features in relation to the target variable, and which features were found to be significantly dependent?\n### Answer 5\n- Chi-square tests indicated significant dependencies for:\n  - **FAVC** (p < 0.01): Strong dependence on obesity levels.\n  - **CAEC** (p < 0.01): Indicates how eating habits impact weight categories.\n  - **SMOKE** and **SCC** also showed significance but were less pronounced.\n- These results can inform which categorical features to focus on for model building.\n\n### Question 6\nWhat key insights and patterns emerged from the visualizations, and how can these insights shape the feature engineering strategy?\n### Answer 6\n- Visualizations indicated that:\n  - The **\"sometimes\"** category for **CAEC** and **FAVC** dominated across obesity levels, suggesting these might be key areas for intervention.\n  - A clear preference for **public transportation** was noted across all weight categories, indicating potential lifestyle correlations.\n  - Gender differences in obesity levels suggest that models might benefit from gender-specific features or stratification.\n\nThese insights can guide the emphasis on specific features and interactions when modeling, as well as inform public health strategies targeting lifestyle changes.\n\n#############\n# TARGET VARIABLE #\n['NObeyesdad']\n#############\n# CLEANED TRAIN DATA WITH FEATURES #\nid,Gender,Age,Height,Weight,family_history_with_overweight,FAVC,FCVC,NCP,CAEC,SMOKE,CH2O,SCC,FAF,TUE,CALC,MTRANS,NObeyesdad\n\n#############\n# CLEANED TEST DATA WITH FEATURES #\nid,Gender,Age,Height,Weight,family_history_with_overweight,FAVC,FCVC,NCP,CAEC,SMOKE,CH2O,SCC,FAF,TUE,CALC,MTRANS\n\n# AVAILABLE TOOLS #\n## TOOL LIST ##\nYou have access to the following tools:\n['one_hot_encode', 'label_encode', 'frequency_encode', 'target_encode', 'correlation_feature_selection', 'variance_feature_selection', 'scale_features', 'perform_pca', 'perform_rfe', 'create_polynomial_features', 'create_feature_combinations']\n## ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ##\nYou can also use functions from public libraries such as:\n- Pandas\n- NumPy\n- Scikit-learn\n- etc.\n## DETAILED TOOL DESCRIPTIONS ##\n## one_hot_encode\n\n**Name:** one_hot_encode  \n**Description:** Perform one-hot encoding on specified categorical columns. The resulting columns will follow the format 'original_column_value'\n**Applicable Situations:** Encoding categorical variables with no ordinal relationship, especially useful for machine learning models that cannot handle categorical data directly (e.g., linear regression, neural networks). Best for categorical variables with relatively few unique categories.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** The input DataFrame containing categorical columns to be encoded.\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array``\n  - **Description:** Column label or list of column labels to encode.\n- `handle_unknown`:\n  - **Type:** `string`\n  - **Description:** How to handle unknown categories during transform.\n  - **Enum:** `error` | `ignore`\n  - **Default:** `error`\n\n**Required:** `data`, `columns`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with one-hot encoded columns  \n**Notes:**\n- One-hot encoding creates a new binary column for each category in the original column.\n- It can significantly increase the number of features, especially for columns with many unique categories.\n- May lead to the 'curse of dimensionality' if used on high-cardinality categorical variables.\n- Suitable for nominal categorical data where there's no inherent order among categories.\n- The function will raise a warning if applied to non-categorical columns.\n- Setting handle_unknown='ignore' will create an all-zero row for unknown categories during transform.\n- Consider using other encoding methods for high-cardinality features to avoid dimensionality issues.\n**Example:**\n  - **Input:**\n    - `data`: {'color': ['red', 'blue', 'green']}\n    - `columns`: color\n  - **Output:**\n    - `data`: {'color': ['red', 'blue', 'green'],\n              'color_blue': [0, 1, 0],\n              'color_green': [0, 0, 1],\n              'color_red': [1, 0, 0]\n            }\n    - `columns`: ['color', 'color_blue', 'color_green', 'color_red']\n\n\n## label_encode\n\n**Name:** label_encode  \n**Description:** Perform label encoding on specified categorical columns. The resulting columns will follow the format 'original_column_encoded'.  \n**Applicable Situations:** Encoding categorical variables with an ordinal relationship, or when the number of categories is large and one-hot encoding would lead to too many features. Useful for tree-based models that can handle categorical data.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** The input DataFrame containing categorical columns to be encoded.\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array``\n  - **Description:** Column label or list of column labels to encode.\n\n**Required:** `data`, `columns`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with label encoded columns  \n**Notes:**\n- Label encoding assigns a unique integer to each category based on alphabetical order.\n- It preserves memory compared to one-hot encoding, especially for high-cardinality features.\n- Suitable for ordinal categorical data where there's a clear order among categories.\n- May introduce an ordinal relationship where none exists, which can be problematic for some models.\n- The function will raise a warning if applied to non-categorical columns.\n- Tree-based models can often handle label-encoded categorical variables well.\n- Be cautious when using with linear models, as they may interpret the labels as having an ordinal relationship.\n**Example:**\n  - **Input:**\n    - `data`: {'fruit': ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'cherry']}\n    - `columns`: fruit\n  - **Output:**\n    - `data`: {'fruit': ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'cherry'],\n              'fruit_encoded': [0, 1, 0, 2]\n            }\n    - `columns`: ['fruit', 'fruit_encoded']\n\n\n## frequency_encode\n\n**Name:** frequency_encode  \n**Description:** Perform frequency encoding on specified categorical columns. The resulting columns will follow the format 'original_column_freq'.  \n**Applicable Situations:** Encoding high-cardinality categorical variables, especially when the frequency of categories is informative. Useful for both tree-based and linear models.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** The input DataFrame containing categorical columns to be encoded.\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array``\n  - **Description:** Column label or list of column labels to encode.\n\n**Required:** `data`, `columns`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with frequency encoded columns  \n**Notes:**\n- Frequency encoding replaces each category with its relative frequency in the dataset.\n- It can capture some information about the importance of each category.\n- Useful for high-cardinality categorical variables where one-hot encoding would create too many features.\n- Preserves information about the distribution of categories.\n- May be particularly useful when the frequency of a category is informative for the target variable.\n- The function will raise a warning if applied to non-categorical columns.\n- Be aware that this method can potentially introduce a false sense of ordinality among categories.\n**Example:**\n  - **Input:**\n    - `data`: {'city': ['New York', 'London', 'Paris', 'New York', 'London', 'New York']}\n    - `columns`: city\n  - **Output:**\n    - `data`: {'city': ['New York', 'London', 'Paris', 'New York', 'London', 'New York'],\n              'city_freq': [0.5, 0.33, 0.17, 0.5, 0.33, 0.5]\n            }\n    - `columns`: ['city', 'city_freq']\n\n\n## target_encode\n\n**Name:** target_encode  \n**Description:** Perform frequency encoding on specified categorical columns. The resulting columns will follow the format 'original_column_freq'.  \n**Applicable Situations:** Encoding categorical variables in supervised learning tasks, especially effective for high-cardinality features.

Features with absolute correlation greater than this value will be selected.\n  - **Default:** `0.5`\n\n**Required:** `data`, `target`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with selected features and their correlation with the target  \n**Notes:**\n- Pearson correlation assumes a linear relationship and is sensitive to outliers.\n- Spearman correlation is rank-based and can capture monotonic relationships.\n- Kendall correlation is another rank-based method, often used for small sample sizes.\n- This method is most suitable for numerical features and targets.\n- Be cautious with high correlations between features (multicollinearity).\n- Consider the domain knowledge when interpreting the results and selecting features.\n- This method does not account for interactions between features or non-linear relationships with the target.\n\n\n## variance_feature_selection\n\n**Name:** variance_feature_selection  \n**Description:** Perform feature selection based on variance analysis. This tool helps identify and remove features with low variance, which often contribute little to model performance.  \n**Applicable Situations:** feature selection, dimensionality reduction, removing constant or near-constant features\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** A pandas DataFrame object representing the dataset with features.\n- `threshold`:\n  - **Type:** `number`\n  - **Description:** Features with a variance lower than this threshold will be removed.\n  - **Default:** `0.0`\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array` | `null``\n  - **Description:** Column label or sequence of labels to consider. If None, use all columns.\n  - **Default:** `None`\n\n**Required:** `data`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with selected features and their variances  \n**Notes:**\n- This method is most suitable for numerical features.\n- A threshold of 0.0 will remove features that are constant across all samples.\n- For binary features, a threshold of 0.8 * (1 - 0.8) = 0.16 would remove features that have the same value in more than 80% of the samples.\n- Consider scaling your features before applying this method if they are on different scales.\n- This method does not consider the relationship between features and the target variable.\n- Be cautious when using this method with small datasets, as variance estimates may be unreliable.\n- Features with high variance are not necessarily informative; consider combining this method with other feature selection techniques.\n\n\n## scale_features\n\n**Name:** scale_features  \n**Description:** Scale numerical features in the specified columns of a DataFrame using various scaling methods.  \n**Applicable Situations:** feature scaling for numerical data, data preprocessing for numerical features, preparing numerical data for machine learning models that are sensitive to the scale of input features (e.g., neural networks, SVM, K-means clustering)\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** A pandas DataFrame object representing the dataset with numerical features to be scaled.\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array``\n  - **Description:** Column label or sequence of labels of numerical features to scale.\n- `method`:\n  - **Type:** `string`\n  - **Description:** The scaling method to use.\n  - **Enum:** `standard` | `minmax` | `robust`\n  - **Default:** `standard`\n- `copy`:\n  - **Type:** `boolean`\n  - **Description:** If False, try to avoid a copy and do inplace scaling instead.\n  - **Default:** `True`\n\n**Required:** `data`, `columns`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with scaled features  \n**Notes:**\n- This function is designed for numerical features only. It should not be used on categorical data.\n- StandardScaler: Standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.\n- MinMaxScaler: Scales features to a given range, usually between 0 and 1.\n- RobustScaler: Scales features using statistics that are robust to outliers.\n- Scaling is sensitive to the presence of outliers, especially for StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.\n- RobustScaler is a good choice when your data contains many outliers.\n- Scaling should typically be done after splitting your data into training and test sets to avoid data leakage.\n- For categorical data, consider using encoding techniques instead of scaling.\n\n\n## perform_pca\n\n**Name:** perform_pca  \n**Description:** Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on specified columns of a DataFrame. This tool is useful for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and data visualization.  \n**Applicable Situations:** dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, data visualization, handling multicollinearity\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** A pandas DataFrame object representing the dataset with features.\n- `n_components`:\n  - **Type:** ``integer` | `number` | `string``\n  - **Description:** Number of components to keep.

Will raise an error if non-numeric columns are specified.\n- Can significantly increase the number of features, potentially leading to overfitting or computational issues.\n- Higher degrees capture more complex non-linear relationships but increase the risk of overfitting.\n- Consider using regularization techniques when using polynomial features with linear models.\n- The function will warn if the resulting DataFrame has over 1000 columns.\n- Polynomial features can be particularly useful for regression problems or for capturing complex interactions in classification tasks.\n- Be cautious of multicollinearity when using polynomial features, especially with high degrees.\n\n\n## create_feature_combinations\n\n**Name:** create_feature_combinations  \n**Description:** Create feature combinations from specified numerical columns of a DataFrame.  \n**Applicable Situations:** Capturing interactions between features that may be important for the target variable. Useful for both linear and non-linear models to learn from feature interactions.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** The input DataFrame containing numerical columns for feature combination.\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array``\n  - **Description:** Column label or list of column labels to use for creating feature combinations.\n- `combination_type`:\n  - **Type:** `string`\n  - **Description:** Type of combination to create.\n  - **Enum:** `multiplication` | `addition`\n  - **Default:** `multiplication`\n- `max_combination_size`:\n  - **Type:** `integer`\n  - **Description:** Maximum number of features to combine.\n  - **Default:** `2`\n\n**Required:** `data`, `columns`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with original and new combined features  \n**Notes:**\n- Only works with numerical features. Will raise an error if non-numeric columns are specified.\n- Can significantly increase the number of features, potentially leading to overfitting or computational issues.\n- Multiplication combinations are useful for capturing non-linear interactions.\n- Addition combinations can be useful for creating aggregate features.\n- The function will warn if the resulting DataFrame has over 1000 columns.\n- Consider the interpretability of the resulting features, especially with high-order combinations.\n- Feature combinations can help in discovering complex patterns that individual features might not capture.\n- Be mindful of the computational cost, especially with a large number of input features or high max_combination_size.\n\n\n"

Create New Features\n**THOUGHT PROCESS:**\n- Calculate BMI using the formula provided.\n- Categorize age into bins.\n- Create an interaction feature between `FAF` and `TUE`.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load the cleaned datasets\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/cleaned_train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/cleaned_test.csv')\n\n# Make copies of the dataframes\ntrain_df = train_df.copy()\ntest_df = test_df.copy()\n\n# Create BMI feature\ntrain_df['BMI'] = train_df['Weight'] / (train_df['Height'] ** 2)\ntest_df['BMI'] = test_df['Weight'] / (test_df['Height'] ** 2)\n\n# Categorize Age\nbins = [0, 18, 35, 50, 65, np.inf]\nlabels = ['Youth', 'Young_Adult', 'Middle_Aged', 'Senior', 'Elderly']\ntrain_df['Age_Category'] = pd.cut(train_df['Age'], bins=bins, labels=labels)\ntest_df['Age_Category'] = pd.cut(test_df['Age'], bins=bins, labels=labels)\n\n# Create Interaction Feature\ntrain_df['FAF_TUE_Interaction'] = train_df['FAF'] * train_df['TUE']\ntest_df['FAF_TUE_Interaction'] = test_df['FAF'] * test_df['TUE']\n\nprint(train_df.head())\nprint(test_df.head())\n```\n\n**EXPLANATION:**\n- **BMI Calculation**: Adds a new column `BMI` by dividing `Weight` by `Height` squared.\n- **Categorize Age**: Adds a new column `Age_Category` by binning `Age` into meaningful age groups.\n- **Interaction Feature**: Adds a new column `FAF_TUE_Interaction` by multiplying `FAF` and `TUE`.\n\n#### TASK 2: Transform Existing Features\n**THOUGHT PROCESS:**\n- Bin `FCVC` and `NCP` into categorical features.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\n# Binning FCVC\nfcvc_bins = [0, 1, 2, 3, np.inf]\nfcvc_labels = ['Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Very_High']\ntrain_df['FCVC_Category'] = pd.cut(train_df['FCVC'], bins=fcvc_bins, labels=fcvc_labels)\ntest_df['FCVC_Category'] = pd.cut(test_df['FCVC'], bins=fcvc_bins,

**Binning FCVC**: Adds a new column `FCVC_Category` by binning `FCVC` into categories like `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Very_High`.\n- **Binning NCP**: Adds a new column `NCP_Category` by binning `NCP` into categories like `Very_Low`, `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Very_High`.\n\n#### TASK 3: Handle Categorical Variables\n**THOUGHT PROCESS:**\n- One-hot encode some categorical variables.\n- Label encode other categorical variables.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder\n\n# One-hot encoding\none_hot_features = ['Gender', 'CAEC', 'CALC', 'MTRANS']\ntrain_df = pd.get_dummies(train_df, columns=one_hot_features, drop_first=True)\ntest_df = pd.get_dummies(test_df, columns=one_hot_features, drop_first=True)\n\n# Label encoding\nlabel_features = ['family_history_with_overweight', 'FAVC', 'SMOKE', 'SCC']\nlabel_encoders = {}\nfor feature in label_features:\n    le = LabelEncoder()\n    train_df[feature] = le.fit_transform(train_df[feature])\n    test_df[feature] = le.transform(test_df[feature])\n    label_encoders[feature] = le\n\nprint(train_df.head())\nprint(test_df.head())\n```\n\n**EXPLANATION:**\n- **One-hot Encoding**: Converts categorical variables into binary columns.\n- **Label Encoding**: Converts categorical variables into numerical values where categories have an ordinal relationship.\n\n#### TASK 4: Normalize or Standardize Numerical Features\n**THOUGHT PROCESS:**\n- Use standard scaling for numerical features.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\n# Standard scaling\nnumerical_features = ['Age', 'Height', 'Weight', 'BMI', 'FCVC', 'NCP', 'CH2O', 'FAF', 'TUE']\nscaler = StandardScaler()\n\ntrain_df[numerical_features] = scaler.fit_transform(train_df[numerical_features])\ntest_df[numerical_features] = scaler.transform(test_df[numerical_features])\n\nprint(train_df.head())\nprint(test_df.head())\n```\n\n**EXPLANATION:**\n- **Standard Scaling**: Scales numerical features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n\n#### Save Processed Data\n**THOUGHT PROCESS:**\n- Save the processed datasets as `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\n# Save the processed datasets\ntrain_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/processed_train.csv', index=False)\ntest_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/processed_test.csv', index=False)\n\nprint(\"Processed data saved successfully.\")\n```\n\n**EXPLANATION:**\n- **Save Processed Data**: Writes the processed train and test DataFrames to CSV files for later use.\n\n### Conclusion\nWith these steps, we have successfully created new features, transformed existing ones, handled categorical variables, normalized numerical features, and saved the processed datasets. This completes the Feature Engineering phase and prepares the data for model building, validation, and prediction."

These tools are pre-defined and pre-imported in the system. You do NOT need import them or implement them again.\n2. Use these tools by calling them with the correct parameters.\n3. Example: To drop specific columns, use the `remove_columns_with_missing_data` tool with appropriate parameters.\n## ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ##\nYou can also use functions from public libraries such as:\n- Pandas\n- NumPy\n- Scikit-learn\n- etc.\n## DETAILED TOOL DESCRIPTIONS ##\n## one_hot_encode\n\n**Name:** one_hot_encode  \n**Description:** Perform one-hot encoding on specified categorical columns. The resulting columns will follow the format 'original_column_value'\n**Applicable Situations:** Encoding categorical variables with no ordinal relationship, especially useful for machine learning models that cannot handle categorical data directly (e.g., linear regression, neural networks). Best for categorical variables with relatively few unique categories.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** The input DataFrame containing categorical columns to be encoded.\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array``\n  - **Description:** Column label or list of column labels to encode.\n- `handle_unknown`:\n  - **Type:** `string`\n  - **Description:** How to handle unknown categories during transform.\n  - **Enum:** `error` | `ignore`\n  - **Default:** `error`\n\n**Required:** `data`, `columns`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with one-hot encoded columns  \n**Notes:**\n- One-hot encoding creates a new binary column for each category in the original column.\n- It can significantly increase the number of features, especially for columns with many unique categories.\n- May lead to the 'curse of dimensionality' if used on high-cardinality categorical variables.\n- Suitable for nominal categorical data where there's no inherent order among categories.\n- The function will raise a warning if applied to non-categorical columns.\n- Setting handle_unknown='ignore' will create an all-zero row for unknown categories during transform.\n- Consider using other encoding methods for high-cardinality features to avoid dimensionality issues.\n**Example:**\n  - **Input:**\n    - `data`: {'color': ['red', 'blue', 'green']}\n    - `columns`: color\n  - **Output:**\n    - `data`: {'color': ['red', 'blue', 'green'],\n              'color_blue': [0, 1, 0],\n              'color_green': [0, 0, 1],\n              'color_red': [1, 0, 0]\n            }\n    - `columns`: ['color', 'color_blue', 'color_green', 'color_red']\n\n\n## label_encode\n\n**Name:** label_encode  \n**Description:** Perform label encoding on specified categorical columns. The resulting columns will follow the format 'original_column_encoded'.  \n**Applicable Situations:** Encoding categorical variables with an ordinal relationship, or when the number of categories is large and one-hot encoding would lead to too many features. Useful for tree-based models that can handle categorical data.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** The input DataFrame containing categorical columns to be encoded.\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array``\n  - **Description:** Column label or list of column labels to encode.\n\n**Required:** `data`, `columns`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with label encoded columns  \n**Notes:**\n- Label encoding assigns a unique integer to each category based on alphabetical order.\n- It preserves memory compared to one-hot encoding, especially for high-cardinality features.\n- Suitable for ordinal categorical data where there's a clear order among categories.\n- May introduce an ordinal relationship where none exists, which can be problematic for some models.\n- The function will raise a warning if applied to non-categorical columns.\n- Tree-based models can often handle label-encoded categorical variables well.\n- Be cautious when using with linear models, as they may interpret the labels as having an ordinal relationship.\n**Example:**\n  - **Input:**\n    - `data`: {'fruit': ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'cherry']}\n    - `columns`: fruit\n  - **Output:**\n    - `data`: {'fruit': ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'cherry'],\n              'fruit_encoded': [0, 1, 0, 2]\n            }\n    - `columns`: ['fruit', 'fruit_encoded']\n\n\n## scale_features\n\n**Name:** scale_features  \n**Description:** Scale numerical features in the specified columns of a DataFrame using various scaling methods.  \n**Applicable Situations:** feature scaling for numerical data, data preprocessing for numerical features, preparing numerical data for machine learning models that are sensitive to the scale of input features (e.g., neural networks, SVM, K-means clustering)\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** A pandas DataFrame object representing the dataset with numerical features to be scaled.\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array``\n  - **Description:** Column label or sequence of labels of numerical features to scale.\n- `method`:\n  - **Type:** `string`\n  - **Description:** The scaling method to use.\n  - **Enum:** `standard` | `minmax` | `robust`\n  - **Default:** `standard`\n- `copy`:\n  - **Type:** `boolean`\n  - **Description:** If False, try to avoid a copy and do inplace scaling instead.\n  - **Default:** `True`\n\n**Required:** `data`, `columns`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with scaled features  \n**Notes:**\n- This function is designed for numerical features only. It should not be used on categorical data.\n- StandardScaler: Standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.\n- MinMaxScaler: Scales features to a given range, usually between 0 and 1.\n- RobustScaler: Scales features using statistics that are robust to outliers.\n- Scaling is sensitive to the presence of outliers, especially for StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.\n- RobustScaler is a good choice when your data contains many outliers.\n- Scaling should typically be done after splitting your data into training and test sets to avoid data leakage.\n- For categorical data, consider using encoding techniques instead of scaling.\n\n\n"

'Very_High']\ntrain_df['FCVC_Category'] = pd.cut(train_df['FCVC'], bins=fcvc_bins, labels=fcvc_labels)\ntest_df['FCVC_Category'] = pd.cut(test_df['FCVC'], bins=fcvc_bins, labels=fcvc_labels)\n\n#

variables.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\n# One-hot encoding using the provided tool\none_hot_features = ['Gender', 'CAEC', 'CALC', 'MTRANS']\ntrain_df = one_hot_encode(train_df, columns=one_hot_features,

successfully.\")\n```\n\n**EXPLANATION:**\n- **Save Processed Data**: Writes the processed train and test DataFrames to CSV files for later use.\n\n### Conclusion\nWith these steps, we have

Below is a detailed description of the data:\n\n1. **Gender**: Categorical variable indicating the gender of the individual (`male` or `female`).\n2. **Age**: Numerical variable representing the age of the individual.\n3. **Height**: Numerical variable representing the height of the individual in meters.\n4. **Weight**: Numerical variable representing the weight of the individual in kilograms.\n5. **family_history_with_overweight**: Categorical variable indicating whether the individual has a family history of being overweight (`yes` or `no`).\n6. **FAVC**: Categorical variable indicating if the individual frequently consumes high-calorie food (`yes` or `no`).\n7. **FCVC**: Numerical variable indicating the frequency of vegetable consumption.\n8. **NCP**: Numerical variable indicating the number of main meals per day.\n9. **CAEC**: Categorical variable indicating the frequency of food consumption between meals (`no`, `sometimes`, `frequently`, `always`).\n10. **SMOKE**: Categorical variable indicating if the individual smokes (`yes` or `no`).\n11. **CH2O**: Numerical variable indicating the daily water intake in liters.\n12. **SCC**: Categorical variable indicating if the individual monitors their calorie intake (`yes` or `no`).\n13. **FAF**: Numerical variable indicating the frequency of physical activity per week.\n14. **TUE**: Numerical variable indicating the time spent using technology devices daily.\n15. **CALC**: Categorical variable indicating the frequency of alcohol consumption (`no`, `sometimes`, `frequently`, `always`).\n16. **MTRANS**: Categorical variable indicating the primary mode of transportation (`automobile`, `public_transportation`, `walking`, `motorbike`, `bike`).\n\nThe cleaned train and test datasets contain these features with some variations in values, indicating diversity in the data. The train dataset includes a target variable while the test dataset does not.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **NObeyesdad**: The target variable represents the obesity level of the individual. It includes categories such as `Insufficient_Weight`, `Normal_Weight`, `Overweight_Level_I`, `Overweight_Level_II`, `Obesity_Type_I`, `Obesity_Type_II`, and `Obesity_Type_III`.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should contain the `id` and the predicted `NObeyesdad` for each individual in the test dataset. The format should be as follows:\n\n| id    | NObeyesdad            |\n|-------|------------------------|\n| 20758 | [Predicted Category]   |\n| 20759 | [Predicted Category]   |\n| ...   | ...                    |\n\nThe `id` column is a unique identifier for each individual, and the `NObeyesdad` column contains the predicted category of obesity level.\n\nIn this phase, you have `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Create new features based on insights from the In-depth EDA.\n2. Transform existing features to improve model performance.\n3. Handle categorical variables (e.g., encoding).\n4. Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.\n5. Select the most relevant features for modeling if necessary.\n6. Other necessary feature engineering steps.\n7. Create `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`.\nOutput: Processed datasets (processed_train.csv and processed_test.csv).\n\n#############\n# PLAN #\n## PLAN\n\n### STEP 1\nTask: Create New Features\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **BMI Calculation:**\n  - **Tools:** `pandas`\n  - **Features:** `Weight`, `Height`\n  - **Parameters:** `BMI = Weight / (Height^2)`\n-

This transformation can reduce noise and make the data more interpretable, but care must be taken to choose meaningful bin thresholds.\n- **Implications:**\n  - These transformations can help the model perform better by reducing the complexity of the relationships, allowing it to focus on the categories rather than the raw numerical values.\n\n### Question 5\n**How were categorical variables handled, and what encoding techniques were used?**\n\n- **Encoding Techniques Used:**\n  - **One-Hot Encoding:** Applied to `Gender`, `CAEC`, `CALC`, and `MTRANS`, which creates binary columns for each category, allowing models to interpret these variables without assuming any ordinal relationship.\n  - **Label Encoding:** Applied to `family_history_with_overweight`, `FAVC`, `SMOKE`, and `SCC`, converting these categorical variables into numerical format for models that can handle ordinal data.\n\n### Question 6\n**What challenges or constraints were encountered during feature engineering, and how might they affect model building?**\n\n- **Challenges and Constraints:**\n  - **Choosing Bins for Binning Features:** The thresholds for binning age, `FCVC`, and `NCP` need to be carefully considered to avoid losing important information and to ensure meaningful distinctions.\n  - **Dimensionality Increase:** One-hot encoding can lead to a significant increase in the number of features, which may introduce sparsity and increase the risk of overfitting.\n  - **Data Leakage Prevention:** Scaling must be applied after splitting into training and test sets to avoid leakage, ensuring that the model generalizes well.\n\nThese constraints and challenges should be addressed to optimize the feature engineering process and enhance the overall effectiveness of model building."

Which files were generated? Answer with detailed file path.\n### Answer 1\n- **Processed Files:**\n  - **Input Files:**\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/cleaned_train.csv`\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/cleaned_test.csv`\n  - **Output Files:**\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/processed_train.csv`\n    - `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/obesity_risks/processed_test.csv`\n\n### Question 2\nWhich features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations.\n### Answer 2\n- **Features Involved:**\n  - **New Features Created:**\n    - `BMI`: Calculated as `Weight / (Height^2)`.\n    - `Age_Category`: Categorized into bins (`Youth`, `Young_Adult`, `Middle_Aged`, `Senior`, `Elderly`).\n    - `FAF_TUE_Interaction`: Interaction feature created by multiplying `FAF` and `TUE`.\n    - `FCVC_Category`: Binned into categories (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Very_High`).\n    - `NCP_Category`: Binned into categories (`Very_Low`, `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `Very_High`).\n    \n  - **Feature Types Modified:**\n    - Numerical features `FCVC` and `NCP` were transformed into categorical features through binning.\n\n### Question 3\nWhat new features were created during this phase, and how do they enhance the dataset?\n### Answer 3\n- **New Features Created:**\n  - **BMI**: Provides a quantitative measure of body weight relative to height, which is a common indicator in obesity studies.\n  - **Age_Category**: Simplifies age representation into meaningful groups, making it easier for models to learn patterns related to age.\n  - **FAF_TUE_Interaction**: Captures the interaction between physical activity and technology use, potentially revealing how these factors together influence obesity.\n  - **FCVC_Category** & **NCP_Category**: These categorical features simplify the understanding of frequency-related behaviors, enhancing interpretability and model performance.\n\n### Question 4\nWhat transformations were applied to existing features, and what are the implications of these transformations?\n### Answer 4\n- **Transformations Applied:**\n  - **Binning of `FCVC` and `NCP`:** \n    - Converted continuous numerical values into discrete categories. This transformation can reduce noise and make the data more interpretable, but care must be taken to choose meaningful bin thresholds.\n    \n- **Implications:**\n  - These transformations can help the model perform better by reducing the complexity of the relationships, allowing it to focus on the categories rather than the raw numerical values.\n\n### Question 5\nHow were categorical variables handled, and what encoding techniques were used?\n### Answer 5\n- **Encoding Techniques Used:**\n  - **One-Hot Encoding:** Applied to `Gender`, `CAEC`, `CALC`, and `MTRANS`, which creates binary columns for each category, allowing models to interpret these variables without assuming any ordinal relationship.\n  - **Label Encoding:** Applied to `family_history_with_overweight`, `FAVC`, `SMOKE`, and `SCC`, converting these categorical variables into numerical format for models that can handle ordinal data.\n\n### Question 6\nWhat challenges or constraints were encountered during feature engineering, and how might they affect model building?\n### Answer 6\n- **Challenges and Constraints:**\n  - **Choosing Bins for Binning Features:** The thresholds for binning age, `FCVC`, and `NCP` need to be carefully considered to avoid losing important information and to ensure meaningful distinctions.\n  - **Dimensionality Increase:** One-hot encoding can lead to a significant increase in the number of features, which may introduce sparsity and increase the risk of overfitting.\n  - **Data Leakage Prevention:** Scaling must be applied after splitting into training and test sets to avoid leakage, ensuring that the model generalizes well."
