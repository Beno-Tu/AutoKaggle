Here are six key questions designed to summarize the findings from the Feature Engineering phase and provide guidance for the next phase, Model Building, Validation, and Prediction:

1. **What new features were created during this phase, and how do they enhance the dataset?**
   - *Purpose:* To summarize the new features such as `BMI`, `Age_Category`, and `FAF_TUE_Interaction`, and their expected impact on model performance.

2. **What transformations were applied to existing features, and what are the implications of these transformations?**
   - *Purpose:* To review the binning of `FCVC` and `NCP`, assessing how these categorical transformations will simplify the model's interpretation of these features.

3. **How were categorical variables handled, and what encoding techniques were used?**
   - *Purpose:* To detail the methods of one-hot and label encoding applied to categorical variables, ensuring the model can effectively utilize these features without misinterpretation.

4. **Were there any numerical features that required normalization or standardization, and what method was employed?**
   - *Purpose:* To confirm that scaling was performed on appropriate numerical features, ensuring that they contribute equally to the model without bias from scale differences.

5. **Which features were deemed most relevant for modeling after the feature engineering process?**
   - *Purpose:* To identify any features that were selected for inclusion or exclusion in the modeling phase, based on their relevance and potential impact on predicting obesity levels.

6. **What challenges or constraints were encountered during feature engineering, and how might they affect model building?**
   - *Purpose:* To reflect on any issues faced—such as handling categorical dimensionality or ensuring meaningful bins in transformations—and consider their implications for the model-building phase.

These questions aim to encapsulate the work done in the Feature Engineering phase and guide the planning of the next steps in Model Building, Validation, and Prediction.
