Understand Background\n2. Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis\n3. Data Cleaning\n4. In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis\n5. Feature Engineering\n6. Model Building, Validation, and Prediction\nCurrently, I am at phase: Feature Engineering.\n\n#############\n# INFORMATION #\nData preview:\n# Data Information\n\n## Data Type\n\n### ID type\n- `id`\n\n### Numerical type\n- `Age`\n- `Height`\n- `Weight`\n- `FCVC`\n- `NCP`\n- `CH2O`\n- `FAF`\n- `TUE`\n\n### Categorical type\n- `Gender`\n- `family_history_with_overweight`\n- `FAVC`\n- `CAEC`\n- `SMOKE`\n- `SCC`\n- `CALC`\n- `MTRANS`\n\n### Datetime type\n- None\n\n## Detailed data description\nThe provided data consists of several features related to individuals' demographic information, lifestyle habits, and health metrics. Below is a detailed description of the data:\n\n1. **Gender**: Categorical variable indicating the gender of the individual (`male` or `female`).\n2. **Age**: Numerical variable representing the age of the individual.\n3. **Height**: Numerical variable representing the height of the individual in meters.\n4. **Weight**: Numerical variable representing the weight of the individual in kilograms.\n5. **family_history_with_overweight**: Categorical variable indicating whether the individual has a family history of being overweight (`yes` or `no`).\n6. **FAVC**: Categorical variable indicating if the individual frequently consumes high-calorie food (`yes` or `no`).\n7. **FCVC**: Numerical variable indicating the frequency of vegetable consumption.\n8. **NCP**: Numerical variable indicating the number of main meals per day.\n9. **CAEC**: Categorical variable indicating the frequency of food consumption between meals (`no`, `sometimes`, `frequently`, `always`).\n10. **SMOKE**: Categorical variable indicating if the individual smokes (`yes` or `no`).\n11. **CH2O**: Numerical variable indicating the daily water intake in liters.\n12. **SCC**: Categorical variable indicating if the individual monitors their calorie intake (`yes` or `no`).\n13. **FAF**: Numerical variable indicating the frequency of physical activity per week.\n14. **TUE**: Numerical variable indicating the time spent using technology devices daily.\n15. **CALC**: Categorical variable indicating the frequency of alcohol consumption (`no`, `sometimes`, `frequently`, `always`).\n16. **MTRANS**: Categorical variable indicating the primary mode of transportation (`automobile`, `public_transportation`, `walking`, `motorbike`, `bike`).\n\nThe cleaned train and test datasets contain these features with some variations in values, indicating diversity in the data. The train dataset includes a target variable while the test dataset does not.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **NObeyesdad**: The target variable represents the obesity level of the individual. It includes categories such as `Insufficient_Weight`, `Normal_Weight`, `Overweight_Level_I`, `Overweight_Level_II`, `Obesity_Type_I`, `Obesity_Type_II`, and `Obesity_Type_III`.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should contain the `id` and the predicted `NObeyesdad` for each individual in the test dataset. The format should be as follows:\n\n| id    | NObeyesdad            |\n|-------|------------------------|\n| 20758 | [Predicted Category]   |\n| 20759 | [Predicted Category]   |\n| ...   | ...                    |\n\nThe `id` column is a unique identifier for each individual, and the `NObeyesdad` column contains the predicted category of obesity level.\n\nIn this phase, you have `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Create new features based on insights from the In-depth EDA.\n2. Transform existing features to improve model performance.\n3. Handle categorical variables (e.g., encoding).\n4. Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.\n5. Select the most relevant features for modeling if necessary.\n6. Other necessary feature engineering steps.\n7. Create `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`.\nOutput: Processed datasets (processed_train.csv and processed_test.csv).\n\n#############\n# NOTE #\n## PLANNING GUIDELINES ##\n1. Limit the plan to a MAXIMUM of FOUR tasks.\n2. Provide clear methods and constraints for each task.\n3. Focus on critical steps specific to the current phase.\n4. Prioritize methods and values mentioned in USER RULES.\n5. Offer detailed plans without writing actual code.\n6. ONLY focus on tasks relevant to this phase, avoiding those belonging to other phases. For example, during the in-depth EDA phase:\n    - you CAN perform detailed univariate analysis on KEY features.\n    - you CAN NOT modify any feature or modify data.\n\n## DATA OUTPUT PREFERENCES ##\n1. Prioritize TEXT format (print) for statistical information.\n2. Print a description before outputting statistics.\n3. Generate images only if text description is inadequate.\n\n## METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS ##\n1. Provide highly detailed methods, especially for data cleaning.\n2. Specify actions for each feature without omissions.\n\n## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ##\n1. Consider runtime and efficiency, particularly for:\n   - Data visualization\n   - Large dataset handling\n   - Complex algorithms\n2. Limit generated images to a MAXIMUM of 10 for EDA.\n3. Focus on critical visualizations with valuable insights.\n\n## OPTIMIZATION EXAMPLE ##\nWhen using seaborn or matplotlib for large datasets:\n- Turn off unnecessary details (e.g., annot=False in heatmaps)\n- Prioritize efficiency in plot generation\n\n#############\n# TASK #\n\nPlease design plan that is clear and specific to each FEATURE for the current development phase: Feature Engineering. \nThe developer will execute tasks based on your plan. \nI will provide you with INFORMATION, RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, and previous reports and plans.\nYou can use the following reasoning pattern to design the plan:\n1. Break down the task into smaller steps.\n2. For each step, ask yourself and answer:\n    - \"What is the objective of this step?\"\n    - \"What are the essential actions to achieve the objective?\"\n    - \"What features are involved in each action?\"\n    - \"Which tool can be used for each action? What are the parameters of the tool?\"\n    - \"What are the expected output of each action? What is the impact of the action on the data?\"\n    - \"What are the constraints of this step?\"\n\n\n#############\n# RESPONSE #\nLet's work this out in a step by step way.\n\n#############\n# START PLANNING #\nBefore you begin, please request the following documents from me, which contain important information that will guide your planning:\n1. Report and plan from the previous phase\n2. Available tools in this phase\n3. Sample data for analysis\n"

What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations.\n### Answer 2\n- The features involved in this phase include:\n  - **Numerical Features**: Age, Height, Weight, FCVC, NCP, CH2O, FAF, TUE.\n  - **Categorical Features**: Gender, family_history_with_overweight, FAVC, CAEC, SMOKE, SCC, CALC, MTRANS.\n  - Target Variable: NObeyesdad.\n  \n- **Changes**:\n  - **Feature Creation**: Potential for creating BMI from Weight and Height.\n  - **Feature Modification**: Features like FCVC and NCP can be binned into categories for easier interpretation.\n  - **No Features Deleted**: All initial features were retained for further analysis.\n\n### Question 3\nWhat are the relationships between categorical features and the target variable (`NObeyesdad`), and which features show the strongest associations?\n### Answer 3\n- **Gender** shows a notable distribution across obesity categories, with females generally having lower obesity levels.\n- **Family history with overweight** indicates a trend towards higher obesity levels in individuals with such history.\n- **FAVC** (frequent consumption of high-caloric food) is strongly associated with higher obesity levels.\n- **CAEC** (food consumption between meals) shows a correlation where \"sometimes\" is linked to higher obesity.\n- **SMOKE** and **SCC** also appear to show differences, but FAVC and CAEC are particularly noteworthy for their strong associations.\n\n### Question 4\nWhat correlations were found among the numerical features and the target variable, and how can these correlations guide the creation of new features?\n### Answer 4\n- A correlation matrix highlights relationships; for example:\n  - Weight positively correlates with obesity levels.\n  - Age shows a slight positive correlation with obesity, suggesting older individuals may have higher obesity.\n- These correlations can guide the creation of features like BMI from weight and height or interaction terms between age and physical activity frequency.\n\n### Question 5\nWhat were the results of the chi-square tests for categorical features in relation to the target variable, and which features were found to be significantly dependent?\n### Answer 5\n- Chi-square tests indicated significant dependencies for:\n  - **FAVC** (p < 0.01): Strong dependence on obesity levels.\n  - **CAEC** (p < 0.01): Indicates how eating habits impact weight categories.\n  - **SMOKE** and **SCC** also showed significance but were less pronounced.\n- These results can inform which categorical features to focus on for model building.\n\n### Question 6\nWhat key insights and patterns emerged from the visualizations, and how can these insights shape the feature engineering strategy?\n### Answer 6\n- Visualizations indicated that:\n  - The **\"sometimes\"** category for **CAEC** and **FAVC** dominated across obesity levels, suggesting these might be key areas for intervention.\n  - A clear preference for **public transportation** was noted across all weight categories, indicating potential lifestyle correlations.\n  - Gender differences in obesity levels suggest that models might benefit from gender-specific features or stratification.\n\nThese insights can guide the emphasis on specific features and interactions when modeling, as well as inform public health strategies targeting lifestyle changes.\n\n#############\n# TARGET VARIABLE #\n['NObeyesdad']\n#############\n# CLEANED TRAIN DATA WITH FEATURES #\nid,Gender,Age,Height,Weight,family_history_with_overweight,FAVC,FCVC,NCP,CAEC,SMOKE,CH2O,SCC,FAF,TUE,CALC,MTRANS,NObeyesdad\n\n#############\n# CLEANED TEST DATA WITH FEATURES #\nid,Gender,Age,Height,Weight,family_history_with_overweight,FAVC,FCVC,NCP,CAEC,SMOKE,CH2O,SCC,FAF,TUE,CALC,MTRANS\n\n# AVAILABLE TOOLS #\n## TOOL LIST ##\nYou have access to the following tools:\n['one_hot_encode', 'label_encode', 'frequency_encode', 'target_encode', 'correlation_feature_selection', 'variance_feature_selection', 'scale_features', 'perform_pca', 'perform_rfe', 'create_polynomial_features', 'create_feature_combinations']\n## ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ##\nYou can also use functions from public libraries such as:\n- Pandas\n- NumPy\n- Scikit-learn\n- etc.\n## DETAILED TOOL DESCRIPTIONS ##\n## one_hot_encode\n\n**Name:** one_hot_encode  \n**Description:** Perform one-hot encoding on specified categorical columns. The resulting columns will follow the format 'original_column_value'\n**Applicable Situations:** Encoding categorical variables with no ordinal relationship, especially useful for machine learning models that cannot handle categorical data directly (e.g., linear regression, neural networks). Best for categorical variables with relatively few unique categories.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** The input DataFrame containing categorical columns to be encoded.\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array``\n  - **Description:** Column label or list of column labels to encode.\n- `handle_unknown`:\n  - **Type:** `string`\n  - **Description:** How to handle unknown categories during transform.\n  - **Enum:** `error` | `ignore`\n  - **Default:** `error`\n\n**Required:** `data`, `columns`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with one-hot encoded columns  \n**Notes:**\n- One-hot encoding creates a new binary column for each category in the original column.\n- It can significantly increase the number of features, especially for columns with many unique categories.\n- May lead to the 'curse of dimensionality' if used on high-cardinality categorical variables.\n- Suitable for nominal categorical data where there's no inherent order among categories.\n- The function will raise a warning if applied to non-categorical columns.\n- Setting handle_unknown='ignore' will create an all-zero row for unknown categories during transform.\n- Consider using other encoding methods for high-cardinality features to avoid dimensionality issues.\n**Example:**\n  - **Input:**\n    - `data`: {'color': ['red', 'blue', 'green']}\n    - `columns`: color\n  - **Output:**\n    - `data`: {'color': ['red', 'blue', 'green'],\n              'color_blue': [0, 1, 0],\n              'color_green': [0, 0, 1],\n              'color_red': [1, 0, 0]\n            }\n    - `columns`: ['color', 'color_blue', 'color_green', 'color_red']\n\n\n## label_encode\n\n**Name:** label_encode  \n**Description:** Perform label encoding on specified categorical columns. The resulting columns will follow the format 'original_column_encoded'.  \n**Applicable Situations:** Encoding categorical variables with an ordinal relationship, or when the number of categories is large and one-hot encoding would lead to too many features. Useful for tree-based models that can handle categorical data.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** The input DataFrame containing categorical columns to be encoded.\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array``\n  - **Description:** Column label or list of column labels to encode.\n\n**Required:** `data`, `columns`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with label encoded columns  \n**Notes:**\n- Label encoding assigns a unique integer to each category based on alphabetical order.\n- It preserves memory compared to one-hot encoding, especially for high-cardinality features.\n- Suitable for ordinal categorical data where there's a clear order among categories.\n- May introduce an ordinal relationship where none exists, which can be problematic for some models.\n- The function will raise a warning if applied to non-categorical columns.\n- Tree-based models can often handle label-encoded categorical variables well.\n- Be cautious when using with linear models, as they may interpret the labels as having an ordinal relationship.\n**Example:**\n  - **Input:**\n    - `data`: {'fruit': ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'cherry']}\n    - `columns`: fruit\n  - **Output:**\n    - `data`: {'fruit': ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'cherry'],\n              'fruit_encoded': [0, 1, 0, 2]\n            }\n    - `columns`: ['fruit', 'fruit_encoded']\n\n\n## frequency_encode\n\n**Name:** frequency_encode  \n**Description:** Perform frequency encoding on specified categorical columns. The resulting columns will follow the format 'original_column_freq'.  \n**Applicable Situations:** Encoding high-cardinality categorical variables, especially when the frequency of categories is informative. Useful for both tree-based and linear models.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** The input DataFrame containing categorical columns to be encoded.\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array``\n  - **Description:** Column label or list of column labels to encode.\n\n**Required:** `data`, `columns`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with frequency encoded columns  \n**Notes:**\n- Frequency encoding replaces each category with its relative frequency in the dataset.\n- It can capture some information about the importance of each category.\n- Useful for high-cardinality categorical variables where one-hot encoding would create too many features.\n- Preserves information about the distribution of categories.\n- May be particularly useful when the frequency of a category is informative for the target variable.\n- The function will raise a warning if applied to non-categorical columns.\n- Be aware that this method can potentially introduce a false sense of ordinality among categories.\n**Example:**\n  - **Input:**\n    - `data`: {'city': ['New York', 'London', 'Paris', 'New York', 'London', 'New York']}\n    - `columns`: city\n  - **Output:**\n    - `data`: {'city': ['New York', 'London', 'Paris', 'New York', 'London', 'New York'],\n              'city_freq': [0.5, 0.33, 0.17, 0.5, 0.33, 0.5]\n            }\n    - `columns`: ['city', 'city_freq']\n\n\n## target_encode\n\n**Name:** target_encode  \n**Description:** Perform frequency encoding on specified categorical columns. The resulting columns will follow the format 'original_column_freq'.  \n**Applicable Situations:** Encoding categorical variables in supervised learning tasks, especially effective for high-cardinality features.

Features with absolute correlation greater than this value will be selected.\n  - **Default:** `0.5`\n\n**Required:** `data`, `target`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with selected features and their correlation with the target  \n**Notes:**\n- Pearson correlation assumes a linear relationship and is sensitive to outliers.\n- Spearman correlation is rank-based and can capture monotonic relationships.\n- Kendall correlation is another rank-based method, often used for small sample sizes.\n- This method is most suitable for numerical features and targets.\n- Be cautious with high correlations between features (multicollinearity).\n- Consider the domain knowledge when interpreting the results and selecting features.\n- This method does not account for interactions between features or non-linear relationships with the target.\n\n\n## variance_feature_selection\n\n**Name:** variance_feature_selection  \n**Description:** Perform feature selection based on variance analysis. This tool helps identify and remove features with low variance, which often contribute little to model performance.  \n**Applicable Situations:** feature selection, dimensionality reduction, removing constant or near-constant features\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** A pandas DataFrame object representing the dataset with features.\n- `threshold`:\n  - **Type:** `number`\n  - **Description:** Features with a variance lower than this threshold will be removed.\n  - **Default:** `0.0`\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array` | `null``\n  - **Description:** Column label or sequence of labels to consider. If None, use all columns.\n  - **Default:** `None`\n\n**Required:** `data`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with selected features and their variances  \n**Notes:**\n- This method is most suitable for numerical features.\n- A threshold of 0.0 will remove features that are constant across all samples.\n- For binary features, a threshold of 0.8 * (1 - 0.8) = 0.16 would remove features that have the same value in more than 80% of the samples.\n- Consider scaling your features before applying this method if they are on different scales.\n- This method does not consider the relationship between features and the target variable.\n- Be cautious when using this method with small datasets, as variance estimates may be unreliable.\n- Features with high variance are not necessarily informative; consider combining this method with other feature selection techniques.\n\n\n## scale_features\n\n**Name:** scale_features  \n**Description:** Scale numerical features in the specified columns of a DataFrame using various scaling methods.  \n**Applicable Situations:** feature scaling for numerical data, data preprocessing for numerical features, preparing numerical data for machine learning models that are sensitive to the scale of input features (e.g., neural networks, SVM, K-means clustering)\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** A pandas DataFrame object representing the dataset with numerical features to be scaled.\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array``\n  - **Description:** Column label or sequence of labels of numerical features to scale.\n- `method`:\n  - **Type:** `string`\n  - **Description:** The scaling method to use.\n  - **Enum:** `standard` | `minmax` | `robust`\n  - **Default:** `standard`\n- `copy`:\n  - **Type:** `boolean`\n  - **Description:** If False, try to avoid a copy and do inplace scaling instead.\n  - **Default:** `True`\n\n**Required:** `data`, `columns`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with scaled features  \n**Notes:**\n- This function is designed for numerical features only. It should not be used on categorical data.\n- StandardScaler: Standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.\n- MinMaxScaler: Scales features to a given range, usually between 0 and 1.\n- RobustScaler: Scales features using statistics that are robust to outliers.\n- Scaling is sensitive to the presence of outliers, especially for StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.\n- RobustScaler is a good choice when your data contains many outliers.\n- Scaling should typically be done after splitting your data into training and test sets to avoid data leakage.\n- For categorical data, consider using encoding techniques instead of scaling.\n\n\n## perform_pca\n\n**Name:** perform_pca  \n**Description:** Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on specified columns of a DataFrame. This tool is useful for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and data visualization.  \n**Applicable Situations:** dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, data visualization, handling multicollinearity\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** A pandas DataFrame object representing the dataset with features.\n- `n_components`:\n  - **Type:** ``integer` | `number` | `string``\n  - **Description:** Number of components to keep.

If None, use all columns except the target (if target is a column name in data).\n  - **Default:** `None`\n\n**Required:** `data`, `target`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with selected features  \n**Notes:**\n- RFE is computationally expensive, especially with a large number of features.\n- The choice of estimator can significantly affect the results.\n- The 'auto' estimator option will automatically choose based on the target variable type.\n- RFE does not consider interactions between features.\n- The step parameter can be increased to speed up the process, but may result in less optimal feature selection.\n- Consider cross-validation for more robust feature selection.\n- The selected features may not always be the optimal set for all models or tasks.\n- RFE assumes that the importance of a feature is reflected in the magnitude of its coefficient or feature importance score.\n- The function returns only the DataFrame with selected features, without additional information about feature rankings or the RFE model.\n\n\n## create_polynomial_features\n\n**Name:** create_polynomial_features  \n**Description:** Create polynomial features from specified numerical columns of a DataFrame.  \n**Applicable Situations:** Capturing non-linear relationships between features and the target variable. Useful for linear models to learn non-linear patterns, or for enhancing the feature space of any model when non-linear interactions are suspected.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** The input DataFrame containing numerical columns for polynomial feature creation.\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array``\n  - **Description:** Column label or list of column labels to use for creating polynomial features.\n- `degree`:\n  - **Type:** `integer`\n  - **Description:** The degree of the polynomial features.\n  - **Default:** `2`\n- `interaction_only`:\n  - **Type:** `boolean`\n  - **Description:** If True, only interaction features are produced.\n  - **Default:** `False`\n- `include_bias`:\n  - **Type:** `boolean`\n  - **Description:** If True, include a bias column (all 1s).\n  - **Default:** `False`\n\n**Required:** `data`, `columns`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with original and new polynomial features  \n**Notes:**\n- Only works with numerical features. Will raise an error if non-numeric columns are specified.\n- Can significantly increase the number of features, potentially leading to overfitting or computational issues.\n- Higher degrees capture more complex non-linear relationships but increase the risk of overfitting.\n- Consider using regularization techniques when using polynomial features with linear models.\n- The function will warn if the resulting DataFrame has over 1000 columns.\n- Polynomial features can be particularly useful for regression problems or for capturing complex interactions in classification tasks.\n- Be cautious of multicollinearity when using polynomial features, especially with high degrees.\n\n\n## create_feature_combinations\n\n**Name:** create_feature_combinations  \n**Description:** Create feature combinations from specified numerical columns of a DataFrame.  \n**Applicable Situations:** Capturing interactions between features that may be important for the target variable. Useful for both linear and non-linear models to learn from feature interactions.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data`:\n  - **Type:** `pd.DataFrame`\n  - **Description:** The input DataFrame containing numerical columns for feature combination.\n- `columns`:\n  - **Type:** ``string` | `array``\n  - **Description:** Column label or list of column labels to use for creating feature combinations.\n- `combination_type`:\n  - **Type:** `string`\n  - **Description:** Type of combination to create.\n  - **Enum:** `multiplication` | `addition`\n  - **Default:** `multiplication`\n- `max_combination_size`:\n  - **Type:** `integer`\n  - **Description:** Maximum number of features to combine.\n  - **Default:** `2`\n\n**Required:** `data`, `columns`  \n**Result:** DataFrame with original and new combined features  \n**Notes:**\n- Only works with numerical features. Will raise an error if non-numeric columns are specified.\n- Can significantly increase the number of features, potentially leading to overfitting or computational issues.\n- Multiplication combinations are useful for capturing non-linear interactions.\n- Addition combinations can be useful for creating aggregate features.\n- The function will warn if the resulting DataFrame has over 1000 columns.\n- Consider the interpretability of the resulting features, especially with high-order combinations.\n- Feature combinations can help in discovering complex patterns that individual features might not capture.\n- Be mindful of the computational cost, especially with a large number of input features or high max_combination_size.\n\n\n"
