To address the issues in the code snippets and ensure that the processed train and test files have the correct columns, we need to follow a systematic approach. The output messages and test cases indicate that the columns in the processed train and test files are not aligned correctly.

### Analysis
1. **Combine train and test data**: Combining the data is a good practice to ensure consistent one-hot encoding.
2. **One-hot encoding**: The one-hot encoding process seems to be working correctly, but there might be an issue in splitting the combined dataframe back into train and test sets.
3. **Splitting the data**: The splitting process should ensure that the train and test data have the same features, except for the target column `NObeyesdad`.

### Correction
1. **Ensure consistent features**: After one-hot encoding, we need to make sure that the train and test datasets have the same features.
2. **Remove target column from test data**: The target column `NObeyesdad` should be present only in the train dataset.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected code snippets with the necessary fixes:

#### Corrected Code Snippet 1
```python
import pandas as pd

# Combine train and test data to ensure consistent one-hot encoding
train_df['is_train'] = True
test_df['is_train'] = False
combined_df = pd.concat([train_df, test_df])

# One-hot encoding using the provided tool
one_hot_features = ['Gender', 'CAEC', 'CALC', 'MTRANS']
combined_df = one_hot_encode(combined_df, columns=one_hot_features, handle_unknown='ignore')

# Split the combined dataframe back into train and test sets
train_df = combined_df[combined_df['is_train']].drop(columns=['is_train'])
test_df = combined_df[combined_df['is_train'] == False].drop(columns=['is_train', 'NObeyesdad'])
```

#### Corrected Code Snippet 2
```python
import pandas as pd

# Combine train and test data to ensure consistent one-hot encoding
train_df['is_train'] = True
test_df['is_train'] = False
combined_df = pd.concat([train_df, test_df])

# One-hot encoding using the provided tool
one_hot_features = ['Gender', 'CAEC', 'CALC', 'MTRANS']
combined_df = one_hot_encode(combined_df, columns=one_hot_features, handle_unknown='ignore')

# Split the combined dataframe back into train and test sets
train_df = combined_df[combined_df['is_train']].drop(columns=['is_train'])
test_df = combined_df[combined_df['is_train'] == False].drop(columns=['is_train', 'NObeyesdad'])
```

### Explanation
1. **Combine train and test data**: We added a column `is_train` to identify rows belonging to the train and test datasets. This ensures that after combining and processing, we can accurately split them back.
2. **One-hot encoding**: The one-hot encoding step remains the same. We use the provided tool to encode the specified categorical columns.
3. **Split the combined dataframe**: 
   - We use the `is_train` column to split the combined dataframe back into train and test sets.
   - For the test set, we remove the `NObeyesdad` column to ensure it only exists in the train set.

### Confirmation
After making these changes, the processed train and test datasets should have the same columns, except for the target column `NObeyesdad`, which is only present in the train dataset. This should resolve the issues indicated by the test cases.

Please run the corrected code snippets and verify if the tests pass successfully.
