# RESPONSE: MARKDOWN FORMAT

Let's work this out in a step by step way.

## Question 1
**What files did you process? Which files were generated? Answer with detailed file path.**

- **Processed Files:**
  - Training dataset: `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/classification_with_an_academic_success_dataset/train.csv`
  - Test dataset: `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/classification_with_an_academic_success_dataset/test.csv`

- **Generated Files:**
  - No new files were generated in this phase as the focus was on data exploration and analysis.

## Question 2
**Which features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo?**

- **Involved Features:**
  - Numerical Features:
    - `Previous qualification (grade)`
    - `Admission grade`
    - Various `Curricular units` (credited/enrolled/evaluations/approved/grades)
    - `Unemployment rate`
    - `Inflation rate`
    - `GDP`

  - Categorical Features:
    - `Marital status`
    - `Application mode`
    - `Course`
    - `Previous qualification`
    - `Nationality`
    - `Mother's qualification`
    - `Father's qualification`
    - `Mother's occupation`
    - `Father's occupation`
    - `Displaced`
    - `Educational special needs`
    - `Debtor`
    - `Tuition fees up to date`
    - `Gender`
    - `Scholarship holder`
    - `International`
    - `Target` (only in training dataset)

- **Changes:**
  - No features were deleted or created.
  - The types of numerical features remained unchanged, but the analysis identified potential outliers based on IQR methodology.
  - Categorical features had their distributions analyzed, revealing dominant and rare categories without modification.

## Question 3
**What were the dimensions and the structure of the datasets after loading?**

- **Train Dataset:**
  - Shape: (76518, 38)
  - Features: 38 total (including `Target`)

- **Test Dataset:**
  - Shape: (51012, 37)
  - Features: 37 total (excluding `Target`)

## Question 4
**Which features exhibited missing values, and what were their respective proportions?**

- **Train Dataset Missing Values:**
  - Missing values were checked using `isnull()`, but specific proportions of missing values were not explicitly listed in the output summary.

- **Test Dataset Missing Values:**
  - Similar checks were performed, but again, specific proportions were not detailed in the output.

## Question 5
**What statistical characteristics were observed in the numerical features, particularly concerning outliers?**

- **Summary Statistics:**
  - Summary statistics showed various characteristics including mean, median, standard deviation, min, and max for each numerical feature.
  
- **Outliers:**
  - Outliers were identified using the IQR method for each numerical feature. Specific numbers of outliers for each feature were printed.

## Question 6
**What were the distributions and unique categories for each categorical feature, and were any anomalies or inconsistencies detected?**

- **Distributions:**
  - Each categorical feature was analyzed for frequency counts and percentages. Dominant categories and rare categories (less than 5%) were reported.
  
- **Inconsistencies:**
  - Checks for category name inconsistencies (case sensitivity, leading/trailing spaces) were performed, with notes indicating potential issues.

## Question 7
**What correlations were identified among numerical features and their relationship with the target variable?**

- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - A correlation matrix was generated showing the Pearson correlation coefficients among numerical features.
  - Highly correlated feature pairs (|correlation| > 0.7) were identified and reported, indicating potential multicollinearity.

- **Crosstab Analysis:**
  - Crosstab analyses between categorical features and the `Target` variable were conducted to identify strong associations.

## Question 8
**Based on the findings from this phase, what specific data cleaning actions are recommended to prepare for the next phase?**

- **Data Cleaning Recommendations:**
  - Handle missing values in both train and test datasets based on their respective proportions.
  - Address outliers in numerical features, considering methods like capping or removal based on analysis.
  - Normalize categorical features to resolve any inconsistencies detected (e.g., case normalization).
  - Consider removing or combining highly correlated features to mitigate multicollinearity issues.
  - Prepare to encode categorical variables for model building in the next phase.
