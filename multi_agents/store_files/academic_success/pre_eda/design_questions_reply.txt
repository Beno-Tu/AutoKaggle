Based on the provided competition information and the plan for the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase, here are six key questions that summarize the findings of this phase and provide guidance for the upcoming Data Cleaning phase:

### Key Questions

1. **What were the dimensions and the structure of the datasets after loading?**
   - **Purpose:** This question helps summarize the number of rows and columns in the training and test datasets, providing a clear picture of the data's scope and structure.

2. **Which features exhibited missing values, and what were their respective proportions?**
   - **Purpose:** Understanding the extent of missing data is crucial for planning appropriate cleaning strategies, such as imputation or removal of features or records.

3. **What statistical characteristics were observed in the numerical features, particularly concerning outliers?**
   - **Purpose:** Identifying summary statistics and potential outliers informs how these values might skew the data distribution and necessitate cleaning methods like outlier removal or transformation.

4. **What were the distributions and unique categories for each categorical feature, and were any anomalies or inconsistencies detected?**
   - **Purpose:** This provides insights into the categorical data quality, highlighting any issues like typos or inconsistent naming that may require standardization.

5. **What correlations were identified among numerical features and their relationship with the target variable?**
   - **Purpose:** Understanding correlations aids in identifying potential multicollinearity issues and informs decisions about which features might need further cleaning or transformation.

6. **Based on the findings from this phase, what specific data cleaning actions are recommended to prepare for the next phase?**
   - **Purpose:** This question synthesizes key insights and suggests actionable steps, such as handling missing values, removing outliers, or addressing categorical inconsistencies, guiding the planner for the Data Cleaning phase.

These questions are designed to ensure that you have a comprehensive understanding of your dataset's current state and are well-prepared for the next steps in your analysis.
