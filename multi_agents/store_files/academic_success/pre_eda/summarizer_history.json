Specific numbers of outliers for each feature were printed.\n\n## Question 6\n**What were the distributions and unique categories for each categorical feature, and were any anomalies or inconsistencies detected?**\n\n- **Distributions:**\n  - Each categorical feature was analyzed for frequency counts and percentages. Dominant categories and rare categories (less than 5%) were reported.\n  \n- **Inconsistencies:**\n  - Checks for category name inconsistencies (case sensitivity, leading/trailing spaces) were performed, with notes indicating potential issues.\n\n## Question 7\n**What correlations were identified among numerical features and their relationship with the target variable?**\n\n- **Correlation Analysis:**\n  - A correlation matrix was generated showing the Pearson correlation coefficients among numerical features.\n  - Highly correlated feature pairs (|correlation| > 0.7) were identified and reported, indicating potential multicollinearity.\n\n- **Crosstab Analysis:**\n  - Crosstab analyses between categorical features and the `Target` variable were conducted to identify strong associations.\n\n## Question 8\n**Based on the findings from this phase, what specific data cleaning actions are recommended to prepare for the next phase?**\n\n- **Data Cleaning Recommendations:**\n  - Handle missing values in both train and test datasets based on their respective proportions.\n  - Address outliers in numerical features, considering methods like capping or removal based on analysis.\n  - Normalize categorical features to resolve any inconsistencies detected (e.g., case normalization).\n  - Consider removing or combining highly correlated features to mitigate multicollinearity issues.\n  - Prepare to encode categorical variables for model building in the next phase."
