- **Efficiency:** Given the absence of predefined tools, leverage optimized pandas and NumPy operations to handle data efficiently, especially when dealing with large datasets.
  
- **Reproducibility:** Structure your analysis in a clear and logical manner, possibly using Jupyter notebooks, to ensure that each step can be reproduced and reviewed easily.

- **Avoid Visual Overload:** Since the data output preferences prioritize text, ensure that all insights are clearly articulated in textual summaries. Only generate visualizations if absolutely necessary to convey specific insights that cannot be effectively communicated through text alone.

By following this structured and detailed plan, you'll establish a solid foundation for your data analysis, setting you up for success in the subsequent phases of your competition project.
