## **TASK 1: Data Overview and Structure Assessment**

### **THOUGHT PROCESS:**
To begin, we'll load the training and testing datasets from the specified directory. We'll create copies of these datasets to ensure the original data remains unaltered during analysis. After loading, we'll inspect the dimensions of each dataset, list the data types of each feature, check for missing values, and examine the distribution of the target variable in the training set. This foundational understanding will guide subsequent analysis and data cleaning efforts.

### **CODE:**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Define the data directory
data_dir = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/classification_with_an_academic_success_dataset/'

# Load the train and test datasets
train_df = pd.read_csv(f'{data_dir}train.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv(f'{data_dir}test.csv')

# Make copies for processing
train_copy = train_df.copy()
test_copy = test_df.copy()

# Inspect data dimensions
print("Train dataset shape:", train_copy.shape)
print("Test dataset shape:", test_copy.shape)

# List feature types
print("\nTrain dataset feature types:")
print(train_copy.dtypes)

print("\nTest dataset feature types:")
print(test_copy.dtypes)

# Check for missing values in train dataset
print("\nMissing values in Train dataset:")
print(train_copy.isnull().sum())

print("\nPercentage of missing values in Train dataset:")
print(train_copy.isnull().mean() * 100)

# Check for missing values in test dataset
print("\nMissing values in Test dataset:")
print(test_copy.isnull().sum())

print("\nPercentage of missing values in Test dataset:")
print(test_copy.isnull().mean() * 100)

# Examine Target variable distribution
print("\nTarget Variable Distribution in Train dataset:")
print(train_copy['Target'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100)
```

### **EXPLANATION:**
1. **Data Loading:**
   - **`pd.read_csv()`** is used to load both `train.csv` and `test.csv` from the specified directory into pandas DataFrames named `train_df` and `test_df`, respectively.
   - **Copies Creation:** To ensure the original datasets remain untouched during analysis, copies (`train_copy` and `test_copy`) are created using the `.copy()` method.

2. **Data Dimensions:**
   - **`.shape`** provides the number of rows and columns in each dataset. Printing these helps understand the scale of the data.

3. **Feature Types:**
   - **`.dtypes`** lists the data type of each feature (e.g., int64, object). This aids in identifying which columns are numerical, categorical, etc.

4. **Missing Values:**
   - **`.isnull().sum()`** calculates the total number of missing values in each feature.
   - **`.isnull().mean() * 100`** computes the percentage of missing values per feature, providing a relative understanding of missingness.

5. **Target Variable Distribution:**
   - **`value_counts(normalize=True) * 100`** shows the percentage distribution of each class within the `Target` variable, helping assess class imbalance.

## **TASK 2: Univariate Analysis of Numerical Features**

### **THOUGHT PROCESS:**
We'll focus on numerical features, providing summary statistics to understand their central tendencies and dispersions. Additionally, we'll assess the distribution shapes through skewness and kurtosis. Identifying outliers using the IQR method will help in understanding data anomalies that may impact modeling.

### **CODE:**
```python
# Define numerical features based on the data description
numerical_features = [
    'Previous qualification (grade)',
    'Admission grade',
    'Age at enrollment',
    'Curricular units 1st sem (credited)',
    'Curricular units 1st sem (enrolled)',
    'Curricular units 1st sem (evaluations)',
    'Curricular units 1st sem (approved)',
    'Curricular units 1st sem (grade)',
    'Curricular units 1st sem (without evaluations)',
    'Curricular units 2nd sem (credited)',
    'Curricular units 2nd sem (enrolled)',
    'Curricular units 2nd sem (evaluations)',
    'Curricular units 2nd sem (approved)',
    'Curricular units 2nd sem (grade)',
    'Curricular units 2nd sem (without evaluations)',
    'Unemployment rate',
    'Inflation rate',
    'GDP'
]

print("\nSummary Statistics for Numerical Features:")
print(train_copy[numerical_features].describe())

print("\nSkewness of Numerical Features:")
print(train_copy[numerical_features].skew())

print("\nKurtosis of Numerical Features:")
print(train_copy[numerical_features].kurt())

# Identify outliers using IQR
print("\nOutliers in Numerical Features (based on IQR):")
for feature in numerical_features:
    Q1 = train_copy[feature].quantile(0.25)
    Q3 = train_copy[feature].quantile(0.75)
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
    upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
    outliers = train_copy[(train_copy[feature] < lower_bound) | (train_copy[feature] > upper_bound)][feature]
    print(f"\n{feature}:")
    print(f"Number of outliers: {outliers.count()}")
    print(outliers.tolist())
```

### **EXPLANATION:**
1. **Summary Statistics:**
   - **`.describe()`** provides key statistics like count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles for each numerical feature, offering insights into data distribution and variability.

2. **Skewness and Kurtosis:**
   - **`.skew()`** measures the asymmetry of the distribution. A skewness >0 indicates right skew, while <0 indicates left skew.
   - **`.kurt()`** assesses the "tailedness" of the distribution. High kurtosis (>3) signals heavy tails, whereas low kurtosis (<3) indicates light tails.

3. **Outlier Detection (IQR Method):**
   - **Calculating IQR:** The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the 75th (Q3) and 25th (Q1) percentiles.
   - **Defining Bounds:** Outliers are identified as data points below Q1 - 1.5*IQR or above Q3 + 1.5*IQR.
   - **Listing Outliers:** For each numerical feature, the number and list of outlier values are printed. This assists in understanding anomalies that may require further investigation or handling.

## **TASK 3: Univariate Analysis of Categorical Features**

### **THOUGHT PROCESS:**
For categorical features, we'll analyze the frequency distribution to identify dominant and rare categories. Assessing data quality involves checking for inconsistencies such as typos or varying cases, ensuring that the categories are standardized for accurate analysis and modeling.

### **CODE:**
```python
# Define categorical features based on the data description
categorical_features = [
    'Marital status',
    'Application mode',
    'Course',
    'Previous qualification',
    'Nacionality',
    "Mother's qualification",
    "Father's qualification",
    "Mother's occupation",
    "Father's occupation",
    'Displaced',
    'Educational special needs',
    'Debtor',
    'Tuition fees up to date',
    'Gender',
    'Scholarship holder',
    'International'
]

print("\nUnivariate Analysis of Categorical Features:")

for feature in categorical_features:
    print(f"\nFeature: {feature}")
    value_counts = train_copy[feature].value_counts(dropna=False)
    value_percent = train_copy[feature].value_counts(normalize=True, dropna=False) * 100
    freq_table = pd.concat([value_counts, value_percent], axis=1)
    freq_table.columns = ['Count', 'Percentage']
    print(freq_table)
    
    # Identify dominant and rare categories
    dominant_category = value_percent.idxmax()
    dominant_percentage = value_percent.max()
    rare_categories = value_percent[value_percent < 5].index.tolist()
    print(f"Dominant category: {dominant_category} ({dominant_percentage:.2f}%)")
    if rare_categories:
        print(f"Rare categories (less than 5%): {rare_categories}")
    else:
        print("No rare categories (all categories have >=5%)")
    
    # Assess data quality
    unique_values = train_copy[feature].unique()
    print(f"Unique categories ({len(unique_values)}): {unique_values}")
    # Check for inconsistencies (simple checks: unique to lower case)
    normalized_values = train_copy[feature].astype(str).str.strip().str.lower().unique()
    if len(normalized_values) != len(unique_values):
        print("Potential inconsistencies found in category names (case, leading/trailing spaces).")
    else:
        print("No inconsistencies detected in category names.")
```

### **EXPLANATION:**
1. **Frequency Distribution:**
   - **`value_counts(dropna=False)`** computes the count of each category, including missing values.
   - **`value_counts(normalize=True) * 100`** calculates the percentage distribution of each category.
   - **Combining Counts and Percentages:** Using `pd.concat()`, we merge counts and percentages into a single table for clarity.

2. **Dominant and Rare Categories:**
   - **Dominant Category:** Identified as the category with the highest percentage, indicating it dominates the feature's distribution.
   - **Rare Categories:** Categories constituting less than 5% of the data are flagged as rare, which may require special handling or consolidation during modeling.

3. **Data Quality Assessment:**
   - **Unique Categories:** Listing all unique categories helps in spotting unexpected or inconsistent entries.
   - **Inconsistency Checks:** By normalizing categories (stripping spaces and converting to lowercase), we compare the number of unique values before and after normalization. A discrepancy suggests inconsistencies like typos or varying cases, which need to be addressed to ensure data integrity.

## **TASK 4: Initial Correlation and Relationship Assessment**

### **THOUGHT PROCESS:**
Understanding the relationships between features is crucial for feature selection and engineering. We'll compute the Pearson correlation matrix for numerical features to identify highly correlated pairs that may introduce multicollinearity. Additionally, we'll perform crosstab analyses between categorical features and the target variable to uncover potential associations that could influence model performance.

### **CODE:**
```python
# Initial Correlation and Relationship Assessment

print("\nCorrelation Matrix for Numerical Features:")
corr_matrix = train_copy[numerical_features].corr()
print(corr_matrix)

# Identify highly correlated features (|corr| > 0.7)
print("\nHighly Correlated Feature Pairs (|correlation| > 0.7):")
threshold = 0.7
high_corr_pairs = []
for i in range(len(corr_matrix.columns)):
    for j in range(i):
        if abs(corr_matrix.iloc[i, j]) > threshold:
            feat1 = corr_matrix.columns[i]
            feat2 = corr_matrix.columns[j]
            corr_value = corr_matrix.iloc[i, j]
            high_corr_pairs.append((feat1, feat2, corr_value))
            print(f"{feat1} and {feat2} have a correlation of {corr_value:.2f}")

if not high_corr_pairs:
    print("No feature pairs with correlation above the threshold.")

# Assess potential multicollinearity
print("\nAssessment of Potential Multicollinearity:")
if high_corr_pairs:
    for pair in high_corr_pairs:
        print(f"Potential multicollinearity between {pair[0]} and {pair[1]} (Correlation: {pair[2]:.2f})")
    print("Consider removing or combining the highly correlated features to reduce multicollinearity.")
else:
    print("No significant multicollinearity detected based on the correlation threshold.")

# Crosstab Analysis for Categorical Features vs Target
print("\nCrosstab Analysis between Categorical Features and Target Variable:")
for feature in categorical_features:
    print(f"\nCrosstab for {feature} and Target:")
    crosstab = pd.crosstab(train_copy[feature], train_copy['Target'], normalize='index') * 100
    print(crosstab)
    # Identify strong associations (example: difference in distribution)
    print("Note: A more detailed analysis may be needed to quantify the strength of associations.")
```

### **EXPLANATION:**
1. **Correlation Matrix for Numerical Features:**
   - **`.corr()`** computes the Pearson correlation coefficients between all pairs of numerical features.
   - A correlation matrix provides a comprehensive view of how features relate to one another.

2. **Identifying Highly Correlated Features:**
   - **Threshold:** Features with an absolute correlation coefficient greater than 0.7 are considered highly correlated.
   - **Nested Loop:** Iterates through the upper triangle of the correlation matrix to identify and list highly correlated feature pairs.
   - **Recording Pairs:** Such pairs are stored for further assessment.

3. **Assessing Potential Multicollinearity:**
   - **Multicollinearity Impact:** High correlation between features can distort the importance of predictor variables in models, especially linear models.
   - **Recommendations:** Features identified with high correlation may need to be removed or combined to mitigate multicollinearity.

4. **Crosstab Analysis between Categorical Features and Target Variable:**
   - **`pd.crosstab()`** creates a contingency table showing the relationship between each categorical feature and the `Target` variable.
   - **Normalization:** By setting `normalize='index'` and multiplying by 100, we obtain the percentage distribution of target classes within each category, facilitating comparison.
   - **Insight Generation:** This analysis helps in identifying categories that have strong associations with target classes, which can be valuable for feature engineering and model building.
