The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nid,Target\n76518,Graduate\n76519,Graduate\n76520,Graduate\netc.\n```\n\n### Timeline\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\n- **Start Date**\u00a0- June 1, 2024\n- **Entry Deadline**\u00a0- Same as the Final Submission Deadline\n- **Team Merger Deadline**\u00a0- Same as the Final Submission Deadline\n- **Final Submission Deadline**\u00a0- June 30, 2024\n\nAll deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.\n\n### About the Tabular Playground Series\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nThe goal of the Tabular Playground Series is to provide the Kaggle community with a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge. The challenges will generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\n### Synthetically-Generated Datasets\n\nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\n### Prizes\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\n- 1st Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise\n- 2nd Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise\n- 3rd Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise\n\n**Please note:**\u00a0In order to encourage more participation from beginners, Kaggle merchandise will only be awarded once per person in this series. If a person has previously won, we'll skip to the next team.\n\n## Dataset Description\n\nThe dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the\u00a0[Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success)\u00a0dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance. Please refer to the original dataset for feature feature explanations.\n\n## Files\n\n- **train.csv**\u00a0- the training dataset;\u00a0`Target`\u00a0is the categorical target\n- **test.csv**\u00a0- the test dataset; your objective is to predict the class of\u00a0`Target`\u00a0for each row\n- **sample_submission.csv**\u00a0- a sample submission file in the correct format\n\n## Detailed Data Description\nVariable Name\tRole\tType\tDemographic\tDescription\tUnits\tMissing Values\nMarital Status\tFeature\tInteger\tMarital Status\t1 \u2013 single 2 \u2013 married 3 \u2013 widower 4 \u2013 divorced 5 \u2013 facto union 6 \u2013 legally separated\t\tno\nApplication mode\tFeature\tInteger\t\t1 -

Competition Overview\nThe competition is part of the Kaggle Playground Series, aimed at predicting the academic risk of students in higher education. Participants will classify students into categories of dropout, enrolled, and graduate, with accuracy as the evaluation metric.\n\n## 2. Files\n- **train.csv**: Training dataset containing the `Target` variable for model training.\n- **test.csv**: Test dataset without the `Target` variable for which predictions must be made.\n- **sample_submission.csv**: Template file demonstrating the required format for submissions.\n\n## 3. Problem Definition\nThe objective is to classify students based on their academic risk using various features from the dataset.\n\n## 4. Data Information\n### 4.1 Data type\n#### 4.1.1 ID type\n- `id`: Unique identifier for each student (not used in model training).\n\n#### 4.1.2 Numerical type\n- `Previous qualification (grade)`\n- `Admission grade`\n- `Curricular units (credited/enrolled/evaluations/approved/grade)`\n- `Unemployment rate`\n- `Inflation rate`\n- `GDP`\n\n#### 4.1.3 Categorical type\n- `Marital status`\n- `Application mode`\n- `Course`\n- `Previous qualification`\n- `Nacionality`\n- `Mother's qualification`\n- `Father's qualification`\n- `Mother's occupation`\n- `Father's occupation`\n- `Displaced`\n- `Educational special needs`\n- `Debtor`\n- `Tuition fees up to date`\n- `Gender`\n- `Scholarship holder`\n- `International`\n- `Target`\n\n#### 4.1.4 Datetime type\n- None\n\n### 4.2 Detailed data description\nThe dataset includes features related to students' demographics, academic history, and socio-economic factors, providing a comprehensive view of their educational backgrounds and current standing.\n\n## 5. Target Variable\n- **Target**: A categorical variable indicating the academic risk classification (dropout, enrolled, graduate). Present in the training set but absent in the test set.\n\n## 6. Evaluation Metrics\nThe primary evaluation metric is **accuracy**, representing the proportion of true results among all predictions made.\n\n## 7. Submission Format\nThe submission file must include a header and follow this format:\n```\nid,Target\n76518,Graduate\n76519,Graduate\n76520,Graduate\n```\n\n## 8. Other Key Aspects\nThe dataset is synthetically generated, encouraging participants to explore the original dataset for insights into feature distributions. The competition runs from June 1 to June 30, 2024, with specific deadlines for submissions.\n```\n</EXECUTION RESULT>\n\n"
