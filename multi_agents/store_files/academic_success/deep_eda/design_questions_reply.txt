Based on the provided competition information and the plan for In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis, here are six key questions designed to summarize the findings of the current phase and provide guidance for the next phase of Feature Engineering:

### Key Questions

1. **What were the main statistical characteristics and distributions observed for the numerical features?**
   - **Purpose:** This question aims to summarize the key findings from the univariate analysis of numerical features, providing insights into their means, medians, standard deviations, and shapes of distributions, which will inform potential transformations or normalizations needed in the feature engineering phase.

2. **Which categorical features displayed significant class imbalances, and how might these imbalances affect model performance?**
   - **Purpose:** Understanding which categorical features have dominant or underrepresented categories will guide the feature engineering process, helping to decide whether to combine categories, apply techniques like oversampling/undersampling, or create new features that capture this information effectively.

3. **What correlations were identified between the numerical features and the target variable?**
   - **Purpose:** This question will help summarize the bivariate analysis results, highlighting which numerical features have strong associations with the target variable, thus guiding the selection of relevant features for engineering or potential composite features.

4. **What relationships were found between categorical features and the target variable, and which features showed the strongest associations?**
   - **Purpose:** Summarizing the associations will direct attention to categorical features that may be particularly informative for classification, which could lead to the creation of new features or the modification of existing ones to enhance predictive power.

5. **Were there any notable anomalies, outliers, or multicollinearity issues identified in the numerical features?**
   - **Purpose:** Highlighting these issues will help in deciding how to handle outliers (e.g., removal, transformation) and multicollinearity (e.g., through feature selection or combination), which is critical for model effectiveness in the next phase.

6. **What insights or patterns emerged from the exploratory analysis that could suggest new features or transformations for better model performance?**
   - **Purpose:** This open-ended question encourages reflection on the overall findings and creative thinking about how to leverage insights gained during the exploratory analysis to enhance feature sets, ensuring a robust foundation for the upcoming model building process.

These questions aim to provide a comprehensive summary of the findings from the In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis phase while also guiding the transition into Feature Engineering, focusing on actionable insights and strategies for improvement.
