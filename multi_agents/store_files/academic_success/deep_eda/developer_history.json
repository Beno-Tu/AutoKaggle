Data Loading:\n   - Always load data files from the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/classification_with_an_academic_success_dataset/` directory.\n   - Use specific files for each phase:\n     - Data Cleaning: `train.csv` and `test.csv`\n     - Feature Engineering: `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`\n     - Model Building, Validation, and Prediction: `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`\n\n2. Data Saving:\n   - Save image files in the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/classification_with_an_academic_success_dataset/deep_eda/images/` directory.\n   - Save data files in the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/classification_with_an_academic_success_dataset/` directory.\n   - Use clear, meaningful names for image files that reflect their content.\n   - Do NOT use special characters like `/` or spaces in file names.\n   - Save specific files for each phase:\n     - Data Cleaning: `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`\n     - Feature Engineering: `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`\n\n3. Data Processing:\n   - Always work on a copy of the DataFrame, not the original.\n   - Ensure correct data types for all columns before any operations.\n   - Apply consistent modifications (e.g., scaling, encoding) to both training and test sets.\n   - Take care with target-dependent operations on the test set, which lacks the target variable.\n   - Do NOT modify Id-type columns.\n\n## CODING PRACTICES ##\n1. General Rules:\n   - Use `print()` for outputting values.\n   - Avoid writing `assert` statements.\n\n2. Visualization:\n   - Use `plt.close()` after saving each image.\n   - Limit EDA visualizations to 10 or fewer, focusing on the most insightful.\n   - Optimize for large datasets (e.g., `annot=False` in seaborn heatmaps).\n\n3. Efficiency:\n   - Prioritize runtime efficiency, especially for:\n     - Data visualization\n     - Large dataset handling\n     - Complex algorithms\n\n## EXAMPLES ##\n- Before calculating a correlation matrix, ensure all data is numerical. Handle non-numerical data appropriately.\n- Verify consistent data types across columns before merging or joining operations.\n\nRemember: Always consider resource constraints and prioritize efficiency in your code.\n"

Given the constraints, we'll ensure that all numerical features are correctly typed and focus on significant anomalies without overcomplicating the visualizations.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import skew, kurtosis\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport os\n\n# Define the data directories\nDATA_DIR = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/classification_with_an_academic_success_dataset/'\nCLEANED_DATA_DIR = DATA_DIR\nIMAGE_DIR = os.path.join(DATA_DIR, 'deep_eda', 'images')\n\n# Create the image directory if it doesn't exist\nos.makedirs(IMAGE_DIR, exist_ok=True)\n\n# Load the cleaned training dataset\ncleaned_train_path = os.path.join(CLEANED_DATA_DIR, 'cleaned_train.csv')\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv(cleaned_train_path)\n\n# Define numerical columns\nnumerical_cols = [\n    'Previous qualification (grade)', 'Admission grade',\n    'Curricular units 1st sem (credited)', 'Curricular units 1st sem (enrolled)',\n    'Curricular units 1st sem (evaluations)', 'Curricular units 1st sem (approved)',\n    'Curricular units 1st sem (grade)', 'Curricular units 1st sem (without evaluations)',\n    'Curricular units 2nd sem (credited)', 'Curricular units 2nd sem (enrolled)',\n    'Curricular units 2nd sem (evaluations)', 'Curricular units 2nd sem (approved)',\n    'Curricular units 2nd sem (grade)', 'Curricular units 2nd sem (without evaluations)',\n    'Unemployment rate', 'Inflation rate', 'GDP', 'Age at enrollment'\n]\n\n# Ensure all numerical features are correctly typed\ntrain_df[numerical_cols] = train_df[numerical_cols].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce')\n\n# Initialize a dictionary to store descriptive statistics\ndescriptive_stats = {}\n\nprint(\"Comprehensive Univariate Analysis of Numerical Features:\\n\")\n\nfor col in numerical_cols:\n    if col in train_df.columns:\n        col_data = train_df[col].dropna()\n        stats = {\n            'Mean': col_data.mean(),\n            'Median': col_data.median(),\n            'Standard Deviation': col_data.std(),\n            'Min': col_data.min(),\n            '25%': col_data.quantile(0.25),\n            '50%': col_data.quantile(0.50),\n            '75%': col_data.quantile(0.75),\n            'Max': col_data.max(),\n            'Skewness': skew(col_data),\n            'Kurtosis': kurtosis(col_data)\n        }\n        descriptive_stats[col] = stats\n        # Print the descriptive statistics\n        print(f\"Feature: {col}\")\n        for stat_name, value in stats.items():\n            print(f\"  {stat_name}: {value:.4f}\")\n        print(\"\\n\")\n\n        # Generate Histogram\n        plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))\n        sns.histplot(col_data, kde=True, bins=30, color='blue', edgecolor='black', stat=\"density\")\n        plt.title(f'Histogram of {col}')\n        plt.xlabel(col)\n        plt.ylabel('Density')\n        histogram_path = os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, f'{col.replace(\" \", \"_\")}_histogram.png')\n        plt.savefig(histogram_path, bbox_inches='tight')\n        plt.close()\n        print(f\"Saved histogram for '{col}' at {histogram_path}\")\n\n        # Generate Box Plot\n        plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\n        sns.boxplot(x=col_data, color='orange')\n        plt.title(f'Box Plot of {col}')\n        plt.xlabel(col)\n        boxplot_path = os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, f'{col.replace(\" \", \"_\")}_boxplot.png')\n        plt.savefig(boxplot_path, bbox_inches='tight')\n        plt.close()\n        print(f\"Saved box plot for '{col}' at {boxplot_path}\\n\")\n\n# Optionally, save the descriptive statistics to a CSV file\ndescriptive_stats_df = pd.DataFrame(descriptive_stats).T\ndescriptive_stats_df.to_csv(os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, 'numerical_descriptive_stats.csv'))\nprint(\"Descriptive statistics saved to 'numerical_descriptive_stats.csv'\")\n```\n\n**EXPLANATION:**\n\nThe code performs a comprehensive univariate analysis on all numerical features in the training dataset. It starts by loading the cleaned training data and ensuring that all numerical columns are of the correct data type. For each numerical feature, it calculates descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles, skewness, and kurtosis. These statistics are printed for review and saved into a CSV file for future reference.\n\nAdditionally, for each numerical feature, the code generates and saves a histogram and a box plot to visualize the distribution and identify potential outliers. The images are saved in the specified `deep_eda/images/` directory with clear and meaningful filenames. After saving each plot, `plt.close()` is called to free up memory, adhering to the constraints.\n\n---\n\n### TASK 2: Detailed Univariate Analysis of Categorical Features\n\n**THOUGHT PROCESS:**\n\nThe goal of this task is to analyze each categorical feature by examining the frequency and proportion of each category. This helps in identifying class imbalances and potential data quality issues like unexpected categories or inconsistent labeling. Given the constraints, we will focus on categories that are underrepresented (e.g., less than 5%) and ensure that category labels are consistent.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\n# Define categorical columns\ncategorical_cols = [\n    'Marital status', 'Application mode', 'Course', 'Previous qualification',\n    'Nacionality', \"Mother's qualification\", \"Father's qualification\",\n    \"Mother's occupation\", \"Father's occupation\", 'Displaced',\n    'Educational special needs', 'Debtor', 'Tuition fees up to date',\n    'Gender', 'Scholarship holder', 'International'\n]\n\nprint(\"Detailed Univariate Analysis of Categorical Features:\\n\")\n\nfor col in categorical_cols:\n    if col in train_df.columns:\n        col_data = train_df[col].dropna()\n        value_counts = col_data.value_counts()\n        proportions = col_data.value_counts(normalize=True) * 100\n        category_df = pd.DataFrame({\n            'Count': value_counts,\n            'Proportion (%)': proportions.round(2)\n        })\n        print(f\"Feature: {col}\")\n        print(category_df)\n        print(\"\\n\")\n\n        # Save the value counts to a CSV file\n        category_csv_path = os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, f'{col.replace(\" \", \"_\")}_value_counts.csv')\n        category_df.to_csv(category_csv_path)\n        print(f\"Saved value counts for '{col}' at {category_csv_path}\")\n\n        # Identify categories with less than 5% proportion\n        low_freq = category_df[category_df['Proportion (%)'] < 5]\n        if not low_freq.empty:\n            print(f\"Categories in '{col}' with less than 5% proportion:\")\n            print(low_freq)\n            print(\"\\n\")\n\n        # Generate Bar Plot\n        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n        sns.countplot(data=train_df, x=col, order=value_counts.index, palette='viridis')\n        plt.title(f'Count Plot of {col}')\n        plt.xlabel(col)\n        plt.ylabel('Count')\n        plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')\n        plt.tight_layout()\n        barplot_path = os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, f'{col.replace(\" \", \"_\")}_countplot.png')\n        plt.savefig(barplot_path)\n        plt.close()\n        print(f\"Saved count plot for '{col}' at {barplot_path}\\n\")\n```\n\n**EXPLANATION:**\n\nThis script conducts a detailed univariate analysis of all categorical features in the training dataset. For each categorical column, it calculates the count and proportion of each category, printing the results for review. These counts are also saved as CSV files in the `deep_eda/images/` directory for documentation purposes.\n\nThe code identifies and prints categories that constitute less than 5% of the data, highlighting potential class imbalances or rare categories that might need special attention during modeling. Additionally, for each categorical feature, a count plot is generated and saved to visualize the distribution of categories. The plots are saved with clear filenames, and `plt.close()` is used after each save to manage memory efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### TASK 3: Bivariate Analysis Between Features and Target Variable\n\n**THOUGHT PROCESS:**\n\nThe objective here is to understand the relationship between each feature and the target variable (`Target`). For numerical features, we'll segment the data by target classes and compute descriptive statistics. For categorical features, we'll examine the distribution of categories across target classes and calculate association metrics like Chi-Square for categorical and correlation coefficients for numerical features. This analysis will help identify which features have significant relationships with the target, guiding feature engineering and selection.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2_contingency\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n\n# Define target variable\ntarget = 'Target'\nif target not in train_df.columns:\n    print(f\"Target variable '{target}' not found in the dataset.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Bivariate Analysis Between Features and Target Variable:\\n\")\n\n    #

It then calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between the numerical feature and the encoded target variable to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship. Box plots are generated to visually assess how the distribution of each numerical feature varies across different target classes. Significant correlations (absolute correlation greater than 0.1) are highlighted in the summary.\n\n- **Categorical Features:** For each categorical feature, a contingency table is created to show the distribution of categories across target classes. The Chi-Square test is performed to determine if there is a significant association between the categorical feature and the target variable. Stacked bar plots are generated for visual inspection of these relationships. Features with p-values less than 0.05 are considered to have significant associations and are highlighted in the summary.\n\nAll association metrics are saved as CSV files for documentation and further analysis. Visualizations are saved with descriptive filenames, and `plt.close()` is used after each plot to manage memory efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### TASK 4: Correlation and Multivariate Analysis of Numerical Features\n\n**THOUGHT PROCESS:**\n\nThe aim is to examine the pairwise correlations among numerical features to identify multicollinearity issues. A correlation matrix will highlight strong relationships (|r| > 0.7), and a Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis will quantify the degree of multicollinearity for each feature. Features with high VIF scores may be candidates for removal or transformation to reduce redundancy and improve model performance.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor\n\nprint(\"Correlation and Multivariate Analysis of Numerical Features:\\n\")\n\n# Compute the correlation matrix\ncorr_matrix = train_df[numerical_cols].corr(method='pearson')\n\n# Select correlations with absolute value greater than 0.7\nhigh_corr = corr_matrix[(corr_matrix.abs() > 0.7) & (corr_matrix.abs() < 1.0)]\n\n# Display high correlations\nprint(\"Pairs of Numerical Features with |Pearson Correlation| > 0.7:\\n\")\nhigh_corr_pairs = high_corr.stack().reset_index()\nhigh_corr_pairs.columns = ['Feature 1', 'Feature 2', 'Pearson Correlation']\nprint(high_corr_pairs)\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# Save high correlations to CSV\nhigh_corr_pairs.to_csv(os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, 'high_correlations_numerical_features.csv'), index=False)\nprint(\"High correlation pairs saved to 'high_correlations_numerical_features.csv'\\n\")\n\n# Calculate Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)\n# VIF is calculated for each feature by regressing it against all other features\n# First, drop any columns with missing values\nvif_data = train_df[numerical_cols].dropna()\n\n# Add a constant term for VIF calculation\nX = sm.add_constant(vif_data)\n\nvif = pd.DataFrame()\nvif['Feature'] = numerical_cols\nvif['VIF'] = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i+1) for i in range(len(numerical_cols))]  # +1 to skip the constant\n\nprint(\"Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for Numerical Features:\\n\")\nprint(vif)\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# Save VIF results to CSV\nvif.to_csv(os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, 'vif_numerical_features.csv'), index=False)\nprint(\"VIF results saved to 'vif_numerical_features.csv'\\n\")\n\n# Recommendations based on VIF\nhigh_vif = vif[vif['VIF'] > 5]\nif not high_vif.empty:\n    print(\"Features with VIF > 5, indicating multicollinearity:\\n\")\n    print(high_vif)\n    print(\"\\nConsider removing or combining these features to reduce multicollinearity.\\n\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No features with VIF > 5 detected.

Pairs of features with an absolute correlation greater than 0.7 are identified and saved to a CSV file. This helps in spotting highly correlated feature pairs that may need to be addressed.\n\n2. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):** VIF quantifies the severity of multicollinearity in regression analysis. Each numerical feature's VIF is calculated by regressing it against all other numerical features. A VIF value greater than 5 suggests significant multicollinearity, indicating that the feature may be redundant and could potentially be removed or combined with other features. The VIF results are saved for documentation.\n\n3. **Recommendations:** If any features have a VIF greater than 5, they are listed with a recommendation to consider their removal or combination to mitigate multicollinearity.\n\n4. **Correlation Heatmap:** A heatmap visualizing the entire correlation matrix is generated and saved. This provides a comprehensive view of how all numerical features relate to each other, facilitating the identification of patterns and relationships.\n\nAll findings are saved appropriately in the `deep_eda/images/` directory, and `plt.close()` ensures that memory is managed efficiently after each plot is saved.\n\n---"
