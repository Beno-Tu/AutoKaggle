## **Summary of the In-depth EDA Phase**

By executing the above four tasks, you will achieve a thorough understanding of both individual features and their interactions within the dataset. This comprehensive analysis will uncover critical insights, guide feature engineering, and set a solid foundation for the subsequent model-building phase, ultimately enhancing your ability to accurately predict academic risk classifications.

**Note:** Throughout the EDA process, adhere to the following guidelines to ensure efficiency and clarity:

- **Textual Emphasis:** Prioritize presenting statistical information in text format with clear descriptions before any visual aids.
- **Limited Visualizations:** If necessary, generate no more than 10 well-optimized visualizations to complement textual insights, ensuring they provide substantial value without overcomplicating the analysis.
- **Efficiency Considerations:** Utilize vectorized operations and efficient libraries to handle large datasets and complex computations without significant runtime delays.
- **Focus on Relevance:** Concentrate on features and relationships that directly impact the target variable and overall model performance, avoiding peripheral or less impactful analyses.

By adhering to this plan, you will conduct a meticulous and resource-efficient in-depth EDA, positioning your project for successful outcomes in the competition.
