Here is a detailed description of the image and the insights that can be derived from it:\n\n### Detailed Description:\n\n1. **X-axis (Target Groups)**:\n    - The x-axis represents the three target groups: Graduate, Dropout, and Enrolled.\n\n2. **Y-axis (Admission Grade)**:\n    - The y-axis indicates the admission grades, ranging approximately from 100 to 160.\n\n3. **Box Plot Components**:\n    - **Box**: Represents the interquartile range (IQR) which contains the middle 50% of the data.\n    - **Median Line**: The horizontal line inside the box represents the median admission grade for each group.\n    - **Whiskers**: The lines extending from the box to the highest and lowest values within 1.5 times the IQR.\n    - **Outliers**: Data points outside the whiskers are marked as individual points.\n\n### Observations and Insights:\n\n1. **Graduate Group**:\n    - **Median**: The median admission grade is around 130.\n    - **IQR**: The middle 50% of admission grades range approximately from 120 to 135.\n    - **Range**: The overall range of admission grades is from about 100 to 150.\n    - **Outliers**: There are a few outliers below 100.\n\n2. **Dropout Group**:\n    - **Median**: The median admission grade is around 120.\n    - **IQR**: The middle 50% of admission grades range approximately from 110 to 130.\n    - **Range**: The overall range of admission grades is from about 100 to 150.\n    - **Outliers**: There is one outlier above 150.\n\n3. **Enrolled Group**:\n    - **Median**: The median admission grade is around 125.\n    - **IQR**: The middle 50% of admission grades range approximately from 115 to 135.\n    - **Range**: The overall range of admission grades is from about 100 to 150.\n    - **Outliers**: There are several outliers above 150 and one below 100.\n\n### Insights:\n\n1. **Comparison of Medians**:\n    - The median admission grade is highest for the Graduate group (~130), followed by the Enrolled group (~125), and lowest for the Dropout group (~120). This suggests that higher admission grades may be associated with a higher likelihood of graduation.\n\n2. **Distribution Spread**:\n    - The IQR for the Graduate group is narrower compared to the Dropout and Enrolled groups, indicating that the admission grades for graduates are more concentrated around the median.\n    - The Dropout group shows a relatively wider spread, indicating more variability in admission grades among dropouts.\n\n3. **Outliers**:\n    - The presence of outliers in the Enrolled group above 150 suggests that some students with exceptionally high admission grades choose to enroll rather than graduate immediately.\n    - The outliers below 100 in the Graduate and Enrolled groups indicate that a few students with lower admission grades still manage to graduate or stay enrolled.\n\n4. **Overall Range**:\n    - All three groups have a similar overall range for admission grades (approximately 100 to 150), indicating that the admission grade threshold for these groups overlaps significantly.\n\nIn conclusion, the box plot reveals that higher admission grades are generally associated with a higher likelihood of graduation, while lower admission grades are more common among dropouts. However, there is considerable overlap in the admission grades across all three groups, suggesting that factors other than admission grades also play a significant role in determining student outcomes.\n## IMAGE: Age_at_enrollment_vs_Target_boxplot.png ##\nThis image is a box plot that visualizes the distribution of ages at enrollment for three different groups: \"Graduate,\" \"Dropout,\" and \"Enrolled.\" The plot aims to compare the age distribution among these three categories.\n\n### Detailed Description\n\n1. **Axes:**\n   - The x-axis represents the \"Target\" group, which includes three categories: Graduate, Dropout, and Enrolled.\n   - The y-axis represents the \"Age at enrollment.\"\n\n2. **Box Plots:**\n   - Each box plot displays the distribution of ages within each target group.\n   - The central box represents the interquartile range (IQR) which contains the middle 50% of the data.\n   - The line inside each box represents the median age.\n   - The \"whiskers\" extend to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 times the IQR from the lower and upper quartiles, respectively.\n   - Outliers are represented by individual points beyond the whiskers.\n\n### Analysis by Group:\n\n1. **Graduate:**\n   - Median Age: Approximately 20 years.\n   - IQR: Ranges from around 18 to 22 years.\n   - Whiskers: Extend roughly from 17 to 25 years.\n   - Outliers: Several outliers extend up to around 65 years.\n\n2. **Dropout:**\n   - Median Age: Approximately 25 years.\n   - IQR: Ranges from around 20 to 30 years.\n   - Whiskers: Extend roughly from 18 to 45 years.\n   - Outliers: Several outliers extend up to around 65 years.\n\n3. **Enrolled:**\n   - Median Age: Approximately 20 years.\n   - IQR: Ranges from around 18 to 22 years.\n   - Whiskers: Extend roughly from 17 to 25 years.\n   - Outliers: Several outliers extend up to around 70 years.\n\n### Insights:\n\n1. **Age Distribution Trends:**\n   - The age distribution of students who graduate and those who are currently enrolled are quite similar, with a median age of around 20 years.\n   - The dropout group has a noticeably higher median age of around 25 years, indicating that older students are more likely to drop out.\n\n2. **Variability:**\n   - The dropout group shows a wider spread in age (higher IQR and whiskers) compared to the graduate and enrolled groups, suggesting more variability in the ages of students who drop out.\n   - The graduate and enrolled groups have similar and narrower age distributions, indicating a more homogenous age group.\n\n3. **Outliers:**\n   - All groups have outliers, but they are more pronounced in the enrolled group, extending up to 70 years, indicating that there are some significantly older students still enrolled.\n   - The dropout group also has a significant number of outliers, but they are less extreme compared to the enrolled group.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe box plot indicates that age at enrollment is an important factor in understanding student outcomes. Specifically, older students are more likely to drop out, while younger students have a higher likelihood of either graduating or remaining enrolled. This insight could be useful for developing targeted interventions to support older students and reduce dropout rates.\n## IMAGE: Course_vs_Target_stacked_bar.png ##\nThe image displays a stacked bar plot depicting the distribution of student outcomes (Dropout, Enrolled, Graduate) across different course codes. The x-axis represents the different course codes, while the y-axis shows the count of students. The bars are divided into three colors: purple for Dropout, teal for Enrolled, and yellow for Graduate. Here is a detailed description of the data:\n\n### Data Distribution:\n1. **Courses with High Dropout Rates:**\n   - Course 171: Significant proportion of students are dropouts.\n   - Course 8014: Similar pattern with a notable number of dropouts.\n   - Course 9147: High dropout rate.\n   - Course 9351: Dropouts are predominant.\n   \n2. **Courses with High Enrollment Rates:**\n   - Course 8014: Noticeable number of students are still enrolled.\n   - Course 9254: Significant number of students are in the enrollment phase.\n\n3. **Courses with High Graduation Rates:**\n   - Course 9500: Most students have graduated, showing the highest count among all.\n   - Course 9065, 9119, 9238, 9773: Large proportion of students have graduated in these courses.\n\n### Insights:\n1. **Course 9500:** This course has a significantly higher number of graduates compared to others, indicating successful completion rates.\n2. **Courses 171 and 8014:** These have high dropout rates, suggesting potential issues with the course structure, difficulty, or support for students.\n3. **Mixed Outcomes:**\n   - Courses such as 9065, 9119, 9238, and 9773 show a balance between graduates and dropouts, with fewer students still enrolled.\n   - Course 9254 has a more balanced distribution across dropouts, enrolled, and graduates.\n\n### Relationships and Trends:\n- **High Graduates:** Courses with a high number of graduates (9500, 9065, 9119) might indicate effective teaching methods, better student support systems, or more motivated student populations.\n- **High Dropouts:** Courses with high dropout rates (171, 8014) could benefit from additional analysis to understand the underlying causes and implement interventions.\n- **Balanced Courses:** Courses like 8014 and 9254 with balanced outcomes across dropouts, enrollments, and graduates could be indicative of courses in transition or with varying student performance levels.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Further Investigation:** Courses with high dropout rates should be further investigated to identify and address the root causes.\n2. **Support Systems:** Implementing additional support systems in courses with high enrollment but lower graduation rates might help improve graduation rates.\n3. **Best Practices:** Courses with high graduation rates can serve as models to improve other courses, adopting their best practices and teaching methodologies.\n\nOverall, the plot provides a comprehensive overview of student outcomes across different courses, highlighting areas for potential improvement and success stories.\n## IMAGE: Curricular_units_1st_sem_(approved)_vs_Target_boxplot.png ##\nThis image displays a box plot illustrating the distribution of approved curricular units in the first semester among three distinct groups of students: Graduate, Dropout, and Enrolled. Below is a detailed description of the image and insights derived from it:\n\n### Detailed Description:\n\n**Title:** Box Plot of Curricular units 1st sem (approved) by Target\n\n**Axes:**\n- **X-axis (Target):** Represents the three categories of students: Graduate, Dropout, and Enrolled.\n- **Y-axis (Curricular units 1st sem (approved)):** Represents the number of curricular units approved in the first semester.\n\n**Box Plot Components:**\n- **Graduate:**\n  - Median (central line in the box): About 6 units.\n  - Interquartile Range (IQR, represented by the height of the box): From about 5 to 7.5 units.\n  - Whiskers (lines extending from the box): Range from about 4 to 8 units.\n  - Outliers: Values below 4 and above 8, reaching up to 12 units.\n\n- **Dropout:**\n  - Median: About 3.5 units.\n  - IQR: Extends from about 2 to 6 units.\n  - Whiskers: Range from 0 to 8 units.\n  - Outliers: Several values extend above 8, reaching up to 12 units.\n\n- **Enrolled:**\n  - Median: About 5 units.\n  - IQR: From about 4 to 7 units.\n  - Whiskers: Range from 1 to 8 units.\n  - Outliers: Values extend above 8, reaching up to 12 units.\n\n### Insights:\n\n1. **Approval Rates and Graduation:**\n   - Graduates generally have a higher median number of approved units (6 units) compared to Dropouts and Enrolled students.\n   - This suggests that students who approve more curricular units in their first semester are more likely to graduate.\n\n2. **Dropouts:**\n   - Dropouts have the lowest median approval rate (3.5 units) and the widest spread (IQR from 2 to 6 units).\n   - The presence of many outliers above the whiskers indicates that while some dropouts do approve a significant number of units, the majority approve fewer units.\n\n3. **Enrolled Students:**\n   - Enrolled students have a median approval rate of 5 units, which is between the median for Graduates and Dropouts.\n   - The spread of approved units for Enrolled students is similar to that of Graduates but slightly lower.\n\n4. **Variability:**\n   - The approval rates for Dropouts show the highest variability, as indicated by the wide IQR and the presence of many outliers.\n   - Graduates and Enrolled students have similar variability, but Graduates tend to approve more units overall.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom this box plot, we can infer that the number of approved curricular units in the first semester is a potential indicator of a student's likelihood to graduate. Students who approve more units in their first semester tend to graduate, while those who approve fewer units are more likely to drop out. This insight can be valuable for academic advisors and institutions aiming to identify at-risk students early and provide them with additional support.\n## IMAGE: Curricular_units_2nd_sem_(grade)_vs_Target_boxplot.png ##\nThis box plot visualizes the distribution of grades in curricular units during the 2nd semester, categorized by the target outcomes: Graduate, Dropout, and Enrolled. Here is a detailed description of each component:\n\n#### Graduate:\n- **Median:** The median grade for graduates is around 14.\n- **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The IQR (middle 50% of data) ranges from approximately 13 to 15.\n- **Whiskers:** The lower whisker extends down to about 10, while the upper whisker reaches up to approximately 16.\n- **Outliers:** There are several outliers above 16 and one outlier below 10, indicating a few students with grades significantly higher or lower than the general range.\n\n#### Dropout:\n- **Median:** The median grade for dropouts is around 12.\n- **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The IQR ranges from approximately 8 to 16.\n- **Whiskers:** The lower whisker extends down to about 6, while the upper whisker reaches up to approximately 18.\n- **Outliers:** There are no significant outliers beyond the whiskers, indicating a more spread distribution of grades among dropouts.\n\n#### Enrolled:\n- **Median:** The median grade for enrolled students is around 13.\n- **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The IQR ranges from approximately 12 to 14.\n- **Whiskers:** The lower whisker extends down to about 8, while the upper whisker reaches up to approximately 15.\n- **Outliers:** There are several outliers above 15 and one outlier below 8, indicating some students with significantly higher or lower grades than the general range.\n\n### Insights:\n1. **Grade Distribution:**\n   - Graduates tend to have higher and more consistent grades compared to dropouts and enrolled students. Their grades are mostly concentrated around 13 to 15.\n   - Dropouts show a wide range of grades, indicating variability in their academic performance. This could point to inconsistent engagement or other external factors affecting their performance.\n   - Enrolled students have a somewhat tighter grade distribution compared to dropouts but still show a few high and low outliers, indicating some variability in performance.\n\n2. **Performance Trends:**\n   - Higher grades are associated with graduation, as indicated by the median and IQR for graduates.\n   - Dropout students generally have lower median grades and a wider spread, suggesting that lower academic performance might be a factor in dropping out.\n\n3. **Outliers:**\n   - The presence of outliers, especially high outliers among graduates and enrolled students, suggests that while most students perform within a certain range, there are exceptional cases of both high and low performance.\n   - The single low outlier among graduates indicates that even students with lower-than-average grades can still graduate, though they are rare.\n\n4. **Academic Support:**\n   - Students with grades in the lower range of the enrolled category might benefit from additional academic support to prevent potential dropouts.\n   - Understanding the underlying reasons for the wide grade distribution among dropouts could help in designing interventions to reduce dropout rates.\n\nOverall, this box plot highlights the relationship between academic performance (grades) and student outcomes (graduate, dropout, enrolled), providing valuable insights for educational strategies and student support services.\n\n\n#############\n# REVIEW #\n{'final_suggestion': {'agent developer': 'No suggestions necessary as the agent performed excellently.', 'agent planner': 'No suggestions necessary as the agent performed excellently.'}, 'final_score': {'agent developer': 5, 'agent planner': 5}}\n"
