Data Processing:\n   - Always work on a copy of the DataFrame, not the original.\n   - Ensure correct data types for all columns before any operations.\n   - Apply consistent modifications (e.g., scaling, encoding) to both training and test sets.\n   - Take care with target-dependent operations on the test set, which lacks the target variable.\n   - Do NOT modify Id-type columns.\n\n## CODING PRACTICES ##\n1. General Rules:\n   - Use `print()` for outputting values.\n   - Avoid writing `assert` statements.\n\n2. Visualization:\n   - Use `plt.close()` after saving each image.\n   - Limit EDA visualizations to 10 or fewer, focusing on the most insightful.\n   - Optimize for large datasets (e.g., `annot=False` in seaborn heatmaps).\n\n3. Efficiency:\n   - Prioritize runtime efficiency, especially for:\n     - Data visualization\n     - Large dataset handling\n     - Complex algorithms\n\n## EXAMPLES ##\n- Before calculating a correlation matrix, ensure all data is numerical. Handle non-numerical data appropriately.\n- Verify consistent data types across columns before merging or joining operations.\n\nRemember: Always consider resource constraints and prioritize efficiency in your code.\n"

It starts by loading the cleaned training data and ensuring that all numerical columns are of the correct data type. For each numerical feature, it calculates descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles, skewness, and kurtosis. These statistics are printed for review and saved into a CSV file for future reference.\n\nAdditionally, for each numerical feature, the code generates and saves a histogram and a box plot to visualize the distribution and identify potential outliers. The images are saved in the specified `deep_eda/images/` directory with clear and meaningful filenames. After saving each plot, `plt.close()` is called to free up memory, adhering to the constraints.\n\n---\n\n### TASK 2: Detailed Univariate Analysis of Categorical Features\n\n**THOUGHT PROCESS:**\n\nThe goal of this task is to analyze each categorical feature by examining the frequency and proportion of each category. This helps in identifying class imbalances and potential data quality issues like unexpected categories or inconsistent labeling. Given the constraints, we will focus on categories that are underrepresented (e.g., less than 5%) and ensure that category labels are consistent.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\n# Define categorical columns\ncategorical_cols = [\n    'Marital status', 'Application mode', 'Course', 'Previous qualification',\n    'Nacionality', \"Mother's qualification\", \"Father's qualification\",\n    \"Mother's occupation\", \"Father's occupation\", 'Displaced',\n    'Educational special needs', 'Debtor', 'Tuition fees up to date',\n    'Gender', 'Scholarship holder', 'International'\n]\n\nprint(\"Detailed Univariate Analysis of Categorical Features:\\n\")\n\nfor col in categorical_cols:\n    if col in train_df.columns:\n        col_data = train_df[col].dropna()\n        value_counts = col_data.value_counts()\n        proportions = col_data.value_counts(normalize=True) * 100\n        category_df = pd.DataFrame({\n            'Count': value_counts,\n            'Proportion (%)': proportions.round(2)\n        })\n        print(f\"Feature: {col}\")\n        print(category_df)\n        print(\"\\n\")\n\n        # Save the value counts to a CSV file\n        category_csv_path = os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, f'{col.replace(\" \", \"_\")}_value_counts.csv')\n        category_df.to_csv(category_csv_path)\n        print(f\"Saved value counts for '{col}' at {category_csv_path}\")\n\n        # Identify categories with less than 5% proportion\n        low_freq = category_df[category_df['Proportion (%)'] < 5]\n        if not low_freq.empty:\n            print(f\"Categories in '{col}' with less than 5% proportion:\")\n            print(low_freq)\n            print(\"\\n\")\n\n        # Generate Bar Plot\n        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n        sns.countplot(data=train_df, x=col, order=value_counts.index, palette='viridis')\n        plt.title(f'Count Plot of {col}')\n        plt.xlabel(col)\n        plt.ylabel('Count')\n        plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')\n        plt.tight_layout()\n        barplot_path = os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, f'{col.replace(\" \", \"_\")}_countplot.png')\n        plt.savefig(barplot_path)\n        plt.close()\n        print(f\"Saved count plot for '{col}' at {barplot_path}\\n\")\n```\n\n**EXPLANATION:**\n\nThis script conducts a detailed univariate analysis of all categorical features in the training dataset. For each categorical column, it calculates the count and proportion of each category, printing the results for review. These counts are also saved as CSV files in the `deep_eda/images/` directory for documentation purposes.\n\nThe code identifies and prints categories that constitute less than 5% of the data, highlighting potential class imbalances or rare categories that might need special attention during modeling. Additionally, for each categorical feature, a count plot is generated and saved to visualize the distribution of categories. The plots are saved with clear filenames, and `plt.close()` is used after each save to manage memory efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### TASK 3: Bivariate Analysis Between Features and Target Variable\n\n**THOUGHT PROCESS:**\n\nThe objective here is to understand the relationship between each feature and the target variable (`Target`). For numerical features, we'll segment the data by target classes and compute descriptive statistics. For categorical features, we'll examine the distribution of categories across target classes and calculate association metrics like Chi-Square for categorical and correlation coefficients for numerical features. This analysis will help identify which features have significant relationships with the target, guiding feature engineering and selection.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2_contingency\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n\n# Define target variable\ntarget = 'Target'\nif target not in train_df.columns:\n    print(f\"Target variable '{target}' not found in the dataset.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Bivariate Analysis Between Features and Target Variable:\\n\")\n\n    #

It then calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between the numerical feature and the encoded target variable to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship. Box plots are generated to visually assess how the distribution of each numerical feature varies across different target classes. Significant correlations (absolute correlation greater than 0.1) are highlighted in the summary.\n\n- **Categorical Features:** For each categorical feature, a contingency table is created to show the distribution of categories across target classes. The Chi-Square test is performed to determine if there is a significant association between the categorical feature and the target variable. Stacked bar plots are generated for visual inspection of these relationships. Features with p-values less than 0.05 are considered to have significant associations and are highlighted in the summary.\n\nAll association metrics are saved as CSV files for documentation and further analysis. Visualizations are saved with descriptive filenames, and `plt.close()` is used after each plot to manage memory efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### TASK 4: Correlation and Multivariate Analysis of Numerical Features\n\n**THOUGHT PROCESS:**\n\nThe aim is to examine the pairwise correlations among numerical features to identify multicollinearity issues. A correlation matrix will highlight strong relationships (|r| > 0.7), and a Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis will quantify the degree of multicollinearity for each feature. Features with high VIF scores may be candidates for removal or transformation to reduce redundancy and improve model performance.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor\n\nprint(\"Correlation and Multivariate Analysis of Numerical Features:\\n\")\n\n# Compute the correlation matrix\ncorr_matrix = train_df[numerical_cols].corr(method='pearson')\n\n# Select correlations with absolute value greater than 0.7\nhigh_corr = corr_matrix[(corr_matrix.abs() > 0.7) & (corr_matrix.abs() < 1.0)]\n\n# Display high correlations\nprint(\"Pairs of Numerical Features with |Pearson Correlation| > 0.7:\\n\")\nhigh_corr_pairs = high_corr.stack().reset_index()\nhigh_corr_pairs.columns = ['Feature 1', 'Feature 2', 'Pearson Correlation']\nprint(high_corr_pairs)\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# Save high correlations to CSV\nhigh_corr_pairs.to_csv(os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, 'high_correlations_numerical_features.csv'), index=False)\nprint(\"High correlation pairs saved to 'high_correlations_numerical_features.csv'\\n\")\n\n# Calculate Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)\n# VIF is calculated for each feature by regressing it against all other features\n# First, drop any columns with missing values\nvif_data = train_df[numerical_cols].dropna()\n\n# Add a constant term for VIF calculation\nX = sm.add_constant(vif_data)\n\nvif = pd.DataFrame()\nvif['Feature'] = numerical_cols\nvif['VIF'] = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i+1) for i in range(len(numerical_cols))]  # +1 to skip the constant\n\nprint(\"Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for Numerical Features:\\n\")\nprint(vif)\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# Save VIF results to CSV\nvif.to_csv(os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, 'vif_numerical_features.csv'), index=False)\nprint(\"VIF results saved to 'vif_numerical_features.csv'\\n\")\n\n# Recommendations based on VIF\nhigh_vif = vif[vif['VIF'] > 5]\nif not high_vif.empty:\n    print(\"Features with VIF > 5, indicating multicollinearity:\\n\")\n    print(high_vif)\n    print(\"\\nConsider removing or combining these features to reduce multicollinearity.\\n\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No features with VIF > 5 detected.

Pairs of features with an absolute correlation greater than 0.7 are identified and saved to a CSV file. This helps in spotting highly correlated feature pairs that may need to be addressed.\n\n2. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):** VIF quantifies the severity of multicollinearity in regression analysis. Each numerical feature's VIF is calculated by regressing it against all other numerical features. A VIF value greater than 5 suggests significant multicollinearity, indicating that the feature may be redundant and could potentially be removed or combined with other features. The VIF results are saved for documentation.\n\n3. **Recommendations:** If any features have a VIF greater than 5, they are listed with a recommendation to consider their removal or combination to mitigate multicollinearity.\n\n4. **Correlation Heatmap:** A heatmap visualizing the entire correlation matrix is generated and saved. This provides a comprehensive view of how all numerical features relate to each other, facilitating the identification of patterns and relationships.\n\nAll findings are saved appropriately in the `deep_eda/images/` directory, and `plt.close()` ensures that memory is managed efficiently after each plot is saved.\n\n---"

This includes calculating metrics like mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles, skewness, and kurtosis.

It starts by loading the cleaned training data and ensuring that all numerical columns are of the correct data type. For each numerical feature, it calculates descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles, skewness, and kurtosis. These statistics are printed for review and saved into a CSV file for future reference.\n\nAdditionally, for each numerical feature, the code generates and saves a histogram and a box plot to visualize the distribution and identify potential outliers. The images are saved in the specified `deep_eda/images/` directory with clear and meaningful filenames. After saving each plot, `plt.close()` is called to free up memory, adhering to the constraints.\n\n---\n\n### TASK 2: Detailed Univariate Analysis of Categorical Features\n\n**THOUGHT PROCESS:**\n\nThe goal of this task is to analyze each categorical feature by examining the frequency and proportion of each category. This helps in identifying class imbalances and potential data quality issues like unexpected categories or inconsistent labeling. Given the constraints, we will focus on categories that are underrepresented (e.g., less than 5%) and ensure that category labels are consistent.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\n# Define categorical columns\ncategorical_cols = [\n    'Marital status', 'Application mode', 'Course', 'Previous qualification',\n    'Nacionality', \"Mother's qualification\", \"Father's qualification\",\n    \"Mother's occupation\", \"Father's occupation\", 'Displaced',\n    'Educational special needs', 'Debtor', 'Tuition fees up to date',\n    'Gender', 'Scholarship holder', 'International'\n]\n\nprint(\"Detailed Univariate Analysis of Categorical Features:\\n\")\n\nfor col in categorical_cols:\n    if col in train_df.columns:\n        col_data = train_df[col].dropna()\n        value_counts = col_data.value_counts()\n        proportions = col_data.value_counts(normalize=True) * 100\n        category_df = pd.DataFrame({\n            'Count': value_counts,\n            'Proportion (%)': proportions.round(2)\n        })\n        print(f\"Feature: {col}\")\n        print(category_df)\n        print(\"\\n\")\n\n        # Save the value counts to a CSV file\n        category_csv_path = os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, f'{col.replace(\" \", \"_\")}_value_counts.csv')\n        category_df.to_csv(category_csv_path)\n        print(f\"Saved value counts for '{col}' at {category_csv_path}\")\n\n        # Identify categories with less than 5% proportion\n        low_freq = category_df[category_df['Proportion (%)'] < 5]\n        if not low_freq.empty:\n            print(f\"Categories in '{col}' with less than 5% proportion:\")\n            print(low_freq)\n            print(\"\\n\")\n\n        # Generate Bar Plot\n        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n        sns.countplot(data=train_df, x=col, order=value_counts.index, palette='viridis')\n        plt.title(f'Count Plot of {col}')\n        plt.xlabel(col)\n        plt.ylabel('Count')\n        plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')\n        plt.tight_layout()\n        barplot_path = os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, f'{col.replace(\" \", \"_\")}_countplot.png')\n        plt.savefig(barplot_path)\n        plt.close()\n        print(f\"Saved count plot for '{col}' at {barplot_path}\\n\")\n```\n\n**EXPLANATION:**\n\nThis script conducts a detailed univariate analysis of all categorical features in the training dataset. For each categorical column, it calculates the count and proportion of each category, printing the results for review. These counts are also saved as CSV files in the `deep_eda/images/` directory for documentation purposes.\n\nThe code identifies and prints categories that constitute less than 5% of the data, highlighting potential class imbalances or rare categories that might need special attention during modeling. Additionally, for each categorical feature, a count plot is generated and saved to visualize the distribution of categories. The plots are saved with clear filenames, and `plt.close()` is used after each save to manage memory efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### TASK 3: Bivariate Analysis Between Features and Target Variable\n\n**THOUGHT PROCESS:**\n\nThe objective here is to understand the relationship between each feature and the target variable (`Target`). For numerical features, we'll segment the data by target classes and compute descriptive statistics. For categorical features, we'll examine the distribution of categories across target classes and calculate association metrics like Chi-Square for categorical and correlation coefficients for numerical features. This analysis will help identify which features have significant relationships with the target, guiding feature engineering and selection.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2_contingency\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n\n# Define target variable\ntarget = 'Target'\nif target not in train_df.columns:\n    print(f\"Target variable '{target}' not found in the dataset.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Bivariate Analysis Between Features and Target Variable:\\n\")\n\n    #

Significant correlations (absolute correlation greater than 0.1) are highlighted in the summary.\n\n- **Categorical Features:** For each categorical feature, a contingency table is created to show the distribution of categories across target classes. The Chi-Square test is performed to determine if there is a significant association between the categorical feature and the target variable. Stacked bar plots are generated for visual inspection of these relationships. Features with p-values less than 0.05 are considered to have significant associations and are highlighted in the summary.\n\nAll association metrics are saved as CSV files for documentation and further analysis. Visualizations are saved with descriptive filenames, and `plt.close()` is used after each plot to manage memory efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### TASK 4: Correlation and Multivariate Analysis of Numerical Features\n\n**THOUGHT PROCESS:**\n\nThe aim is to examine the pairwise correlations among numerical features to identify multicollinearity issues. A correlation matrix will highlight strong relationships (|r| > 0.7), and a Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis will quantify the degree of multicollinearity for each feature. Features with high VIF scores may be candidates for removal or transformation to reduce redundancy and improve model performance.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor\n\nprint(\"Correlation and Multivariate Analysis of Numerical Features:\\n\")\n\n# Compute the correlation matrix\ncorr_matrix = train_df[numerical_cols].corr(method='pearson')\n\n# Select correlations with absolute value greater than 0.7\nhigh_corr = corr_matrix[(corr_matrix.abs() > 0.7) & (corr_matrix.abs() < 1.0)]\n\n# Display high correlations\nprint(\"Pairs of Numerical Features with |Pearson Correlation| > 0.7:\\n\")\nhigh_corr_pairs = high_corr.stack().reset_index()\nhigh_corr_pairs.columns = ['Feature 1', 'Feature 2', 'Pearson Correlation']\nprint(high_corr_pairs)\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# Save high correlations to CSV\nhigh_corr_pairs.to_csv(os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, 'high_correlations_numerical_features.csv'), index=False)\nprint(\"High correlation pairs saved to 'high_correlations_numerical_features.csv'\\n\")\n\n# Calculate Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)\n# VIF is calculated for each feature by regressing it against all other features\n# First, drop any columns with missing values\nvif_data = train_df[numerical_cols].dropna()\n\n# Add a constant term for VIF calculation\nX = sm.add_constant(vif_data)\n\nvif = pd.DataFrame()\nvif['Feature'] = numerical_cols\nvif['VIF'] = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i+1) for i in range(len(numerical_cols))]  # +1 to skip the constant\n\nprint(\"Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for Numerical Features:\\n\")\nprint(vif)\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# Save VIF results to CSV\nvif.to_csv(os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, 'vif_numerical_features.csv'), index=False)\nprint(\"VIF results saved to 'vif_numerical_features.csv'\\n\")\n\n# Recommendations based on VIF\nhigh_vif = vif[vif['VIF'] > 5]\nif not high_vif.empty:\n    print(\"Features with VIF > 5, indicating multicollinearity:\\n\")\n    print(high_vif)\n    print(\"\\nConsider removing or combining these features to reduce multicollinearity.\\n\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No features with VIF > 5 detected.

Pairs of features with an absolute correlation greater than 0.7 are identified and saved to a CSV file. This helps in spotting highly correlated feature pairs that may need to be addressed.\n\n2. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):** VIF quantifies the severity of multicollinearity in regression analysis. Each numerical feature's VIF is calculated by regressing it against all other numerical features. A VIF value greater than 5 suggests significant multicollinearity, indicating that the feature may be redundant and could potentially be removed or combined with other features. The VIF results are saved for documentation.\n\n3. **Recommendations:** If any features have a VIF greater than 5, they are listed with a recommendation to consider their removal or combination to mitigate multicollinearity.\n\n4. **Correlation Heatmap:** A heatmap visualizing the entire correlation matrix is generated and saved. This provides a comprehensive view of how all numerical features relate to each other, facilitating the identification of patterns and relationships.\n\nAll findings are saved appropriately in the `deep_eda/images/` directory, and `plt.close()` ensures that memory is managed efficiently after each plot is saved.\n\n---",

This includes calculating metrics like mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles, skewness, and kurtosis.

It starts by loading the cleaned training data and ensuring that all numerical columns are of the correct data type. For each numerical feature, it calculates descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles, skewness, and kurtosis. These statistics are printed for review and saved into a CSV file for future reference.\n\nAdditionally, for each numerical feature, the code generates and saves a histogram and a box plot to visualize the distribution and identify potential outliers.

After saving each plot, `plt.close()` is called to free up memory, adhering to the constraints.\n\n---\n\n### TASK 2: Detailed Univariate Analysis of Categorical Features\n\n**THOUGHT PROCESS:**\n\nThe goal of this task is to analyze each categorical feature by examining the frequency and proportion of each category. This helps in identifying class imbalances and potential data quality issues like unexpected categories or inconsistent labeling. Given the constraints, we will focus on categories that are underrepresented (e.g., less than 5%) and ensure that category labels are consistent.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\n# Define categorical columns\ncategorical_cols = [\n    'Marital status', 'Application mode', 'Course', 'Previous qualification',\n    'Nacionality', \"Mother's qualification\", \"Father's qualification\",\n    \"Mother's occupation\", \"Father's occupation\", 'Displaced',\n    'Educational special needs', 'Debtor', 'Tuition fees up to date',\n    'Gender', 'Scholarship holder', 'International'\n]\n\nprint(\"Detailed Univariate Analysis of Categorical Features:\\n\")\n\nfor col in categorical_cols:\n    if col in train_df.columns:\n        col_data = train_df[col].dropna()\n        value_counts = col_data.value_counts()\n        proportions = col_data.value_counts(normalize=True) * 100\n        category_df = pd.DataFrame({\n            'Count': value_counts,\n            'Proportion (%)': proportions.round(2)\n        })\n        print(f\"Feature: {col}\")\n        print(category_df)\n        print(\"\\n\")\n\n        # Save the value counts to a CSV file\n        category_csv_path = os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, f'{col.replace(\" \", \"_\")}_value_counts.csv')\n        category_df.to_csv(category_csv_path)\n        print(f\"Saved value counts for '{col}' at {category_csv_path}\")\n\n        # Identify categories with less than 5% proportion\n        low_freq = category_df[category_df['Proportion (%)'] < 5]\n        if not low_freq.empty:\n            print(f\"Categories in '{col}' with less than 5% proportion:\")\n            print(low_freq)\n            print(\"\\n\")\n\n        # Generate Bar Plot\n        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n        sns.countplot(data=train_df, x=col, order=value_counts.index, palette='viridis')\n        plt.title(f'Count Plot of {col}')\n        plt.xlabel(col)\n        plt.ylabel('Count')\n        plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')\n        plt.tight_layout()\n        barplot_path = os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, f'{col.replace(\" \", \"_\")}_countplot.png')\n        plt.savefig(barplot_path)\n        plt.close()\n        print(f\"Saved count plot for '{col}' at {barplot_path}\\n\")\n```\n\n**EXPLANATION:**\n\nThis script conducts a detailed univariate analysis of all categorical features in the training dataset. For each categorical column, it calculates the count and proportion of each category, printing the results for review. These counts are also saved as CSV files in the `deep_eda/images/` directory for documentation purposes.\n\nThe code identifies and prints categories that constitute less than 5% of the data, highlighting potential class imbalances or rare categories that might need special attention during modeling. Additionally, for each categorical feature, a count plot is generated and saved to visualize the distribution of categories. The plots are saved with clear filenames, and `plt.close()` is used after each save to manage memory efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### TASK 3: Bivariate Analysis Between Features and Target Variable\n\n**THOUGHT PROCESS:**\n\nThe objective here is to understand the relationship between each feature and the target variable (`Target`). For numerical features, we'll segment the data by target classes and compute descriptive statistics. For categorical features, we'll examine the distribution of categories across target classes and calculate association metrics like Chi-Square for categorical and correlation coefficients for numerical features. This analysis will help identify which features have significant relationships with the target, guiding feature engineering and selection.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2_contingency\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n\n# Define target variable\ntarget = 'Target'\nif target not in train_df.columns:\n    print(f\"Target variable '{target}' not found in the dataset.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Bivariate Analysis Between Features and Target Variable:\\n\")\n\n    #

It then calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between the numerical feature and the encoded target variable to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship. Box plots are generated to visually assess how the distribution of each numerical feature varies across different target classes. Significant correlations (absolute correlation greater than 0.1) are highlighted in the summary.\n\n- **Categorical Features:** For each categorical feature, a contingency table is created to show the distribution of categories across target classes. The Chi-Square test is performed to determine if there is a significant association between the categorical feature and the target variable. Stacked bar plots are generated for visual inspection of these relationships. Features with p-values less than 0.05 are considered to have significant associations and are highlighted in the summary.\n\nAll association metrics are saved as CSV files for documentation and further analysis. Visualizations are saved with descriptive filenames, and `plt.close()` is used after each plot to manage memory efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### TASK 4: Correlation and Multivariate Analysis of Numerical Features\n\n**THOUGHT PROCESS:**\n\nThe aim is to examine the pairwise correlations among numerical features to identify multicollinearity issues. A correlation matrix will highlight strong relationships (|r| > 0.7), and a Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis will quantify the degree of multicollinearity for each feature. Features with high VIF scores may be candidates for removal or transformation to reduce redundancy and improve model performance.\n\n**CODE:**\n```python\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor\n\nprint(\"Correlation and Multivariate Analysis of Numerical Features:\\n\")\n\n# Compute the correlation matrix\ncorr_matrix = train_df[numerical_cols].corr(method='pearson')\n\n# Select correlations with absolute value greater than 0.7\nhigh_corr = corr_matrix[(corr_matrix.abs() > 0.7) & (corr_matrix.abs() < 1.0)]\n\n# Display high correlations\nprint(\"Pairs of Numerical Features with |Pearson Correlation| > 0.7:\\n\")\nhigh_corr_pairs = high_corr.stack().reset_index()\nhigh_corr_pairs.columns = ['Feature 1', 'Feature 2', 'Pearson Correlation']\nprint(high_corr_pairs)\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# Save high correlations to CSV\nhigh_corr_pairs.to_csv(os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, 'high_correlations_numerical_features.csv'), index=False)\nprint(\"High correlation pairs saved to 'high_correlations_numerical_features.csv'\\n\")\n\n# Calculate Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)\n# VIF is calculated for each feature by regressing it against all other features\n# First, drop any columns with missing values\nvif_data = train_df[numerical_cols].dropna()\n\n# Add a constant term for VIF calculation\nX = sm.add_constant(vif_data)\n\nvif = pd.DataFrame()\nvif['Feature'] = numerical_cols\nvif['VIF'] = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i+1) for i in range(len(numerical_cols))]  # +1 to skip the constant\n\nprint(\"Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for Numerical Features:\\n\")\nprint(vif)\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# Save VIF results to CSV\nvif.to_csv(os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, 'vif_numerical_features.csv'), index=False)\nprint(\"VIF results saved to 'vif_numerical_features.csv'\\n\")\n\n# Recommendations based on VIF\nhigh_vif = vif[vif['VIF'] > 5]\nif not high_vif.empty:\n    print(\"Features with VIF > 5, indicating multicollinearity:\\n\")\n    print(high_vif)\n    print(\"\\nConsider removing or combining these features to reduce multicollinearity.\\n\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No features with VIF > 5 detected. Multicollinearity is not a concern.\\n\")\n\n# Visualize the correlation matrix with a heatmap\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))\nsns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, fmt=\".2f\", cmap='coolwarm', vmax=1, vmin=-1, linewidths=0.5, annot_kws={\"size\":8})\nplt.title('Correlation Matrix of Numerical Features')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')\nplt.yticks(rotation=0)\nheatmap_path = os.path.join(IMAGE_DIR, 'numerical_features_correlation_heatmap.png')\nplt.savefig(heatmap_path, bbox_inches='tight')\nplt.close()\nprint(f\"Saved correlation heatmap at {heatmap_path}\\n\")\n```\n\n**EXPLANATION:**\n\nThis script conducts a correlation and multivariate analysis of numerical features to identify multicollinearity issues that could affect model performance.\n\n1. **Correlation Matrix:** The Pearson correlation matrix is computed for all numerical features. Pairs of features with an absolute correlation greater than 0.7 are identified and saved to a CSV file. This helps in spotting highly correlated feature pairs that may need to be addressed.\n\n2. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):** VIF quantifies the severity of multicollinearity in regression analysis. Each numerical feature's VIF is calculated by regressing it against all other numerical features. A VIF value greater than 5 suggests significant multicollinearity, indicating that the feature may be redundant and could potentially be removed or combined with other features. The VIF results are saved for documentation.\n\n3. **Recommendations:** If any features have a VIF greater than 5, they are listed with a recommendation to consider their removal or combination to mitigate multicollinearity.\n\n4. **Correlation Heatmap:** A heatmap visualizing the entire correlation matrix is generated and saved. This provides a comprehensive view of how all numerical features relate to each other, facilitating the identification of patterns and relationships.\n\nAll findings are saved appropriately in the `deep_eda/images/` directory, and `plt.close()` ensures that memory is managed efficiently after each plot is saved.\n\n---\n</EXECUTION RESULT>\n\n"

Here is a detailed description of the image and the insights that can be derived from it:\n\n### Detailed Description:\n\n1. **X-axis (Target Groups)**:\n    - The x-axis represents the three target groups: Graduate, Dropout, and Enrolled.\n\n2. **Y-axis (Admission Grade)**:\n    - The y-axis indicates the admission grades, ranging approximately from 100 to 160.\n\n3. **Box Plot Components**:\n    - **Box**: Represents the interquartile range (IQR) which contains the middle 50% of the data.\n    - **Median Line**: The horizontal line inside the box represents the median admission grade for each group.\n    - **Whiskers**: The lines extending from the box to the highest and lowest values within 1.5 times the IQR.\n    - **Outliers**: Data points outside the whiskers are marked as individual points.\n\n### Observations and Insights:\n\n1. **Graduate Group**:\n    - **Median**: The median admission grade is around 130.\n    - **IQR**: The middle 50% of admission grades range approximately from 120 to 135.\n    - **Range**: The overall range of admission grades is from about 100 to 150.\n    - **Outliers**: There are a few outliers below 100.\n\n2. **Dropout Group**:\n    - **Median**: The median admission grade is around 120.\n    - **IQR**: The middle 50% of admission grades range approximately from 110 to 130.\n    - **Range**: The overall range of admission grades is from about 100 to 150.\n    - **Outliers**: There is one outlier above 150.\n\n3. **Enrolled Group**:\n    - **Median**: The median admission grade is around 125.\n    - **IQR**: The middle 50% of admission grades range approximately from 115 to 135.\n    - **Range**: The overall range of admission grades is from about 100 to 150.\n    - **Outliers**: There are several outliers above 150 and one below 100.\n\n### Insights:\n\n1. **Comparison of Medians**:\n    - The median admission grade is highest for the Graduate group (~130), followed by the Enrolled group (~125), and lowest for the Dropout group (~120). This suggests that higher admission grades may be associated with a higher likelihood of graduation.\n\n2. **Distribution Spread**:\n    - The IQR for the Graduate group is narrower compared to the Dropout and Enrolled groups, indicating that the admission grades for graduates are more concentrated around the median.\n    - The Dropout group shows a relatively wider spread, indicating more variability in admission grades among dropouts.\n\n3. **Outliers**:\n    - The presence of outliers in the Enrolled group above 150 suggests that some students with exceptionally high admission grades choose to enroll rather than graduate immediately.\n    - The outliers below 100 in the Graduate and Enrolled groups indicate that a few students with lower admission grades still manage to graduate or stay enrolled.\n\n4. **Overall Range**:\n    - All three groups have a similar overall range for admission grades (approximately 100 to 150), indicating that the admission grade threshold for these groups overlaps significantly.\n\nIn conclusion, the box plot reveals that higher admission grades are generally associated with a higher likelihood of graduation, while lower admission grades are more common among dropouts. However, there is considerable overlap in the admission grades across all three groups, suggesting that factors other than admission grades also play a significant role in determining student outcomes.\n## IMAGE: Age_at_enrollment_vs_Target_boxplot.png ##\nThis image is a box plot that visualizes the distribution of ages at enrollment for three different groups: \"Graduate,\" \"Dropout,\" and \"Enrolled.\" The plot aims to compare the age distribution among these three categories.\n\n### Detailed Description\n\n1. **Axes:**\n   - The x-axis represents the \"Target\" group, which includes three categories: Graduate, Dropout, and Enrolled.\n   - The y-axis represents the \"Age at enrollment.\"\n\n2. **Box Plots:**\n   - Each box plot displays the distribution of ages within each target group.\n   - The central box represents the interquartile range (IQR) which contains the middle 50% of the data.\n   - The line inside each box represents the median age.\n   - The \"whiskers\" extend to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 times the IQR from the lower and upper quartiles, respectively.\n   - Outliers are represented by individual points beyond the whiskers.\n\n### Analysis by Group:\n\n1. **Graduate:**\n   - Median Age: Approximately 20 years.\n   - IQR: Ranges from around 18 to 22 years.\n   - Whiskers: Extend roughly from 17 to 25 years.\n   - Outliers: Several outliers extend up to around 65 years.\n\n2. **Dropout:**\n   - Median Age: Approximately 25 years.\n   - IQR: Ranges from around 20 to 30 years.\n   - Whiskers: Extend roughly from 18 to 45 years.\n   - Outliers: Several outliers extend up to around 65 years.\n\n3. **Enrolled:**\n   - Median Age: Approximately 20 years.\n   - IQR: Ranges from around 18 to 22 years.\n   - Whiskers: Extend roughly from 17 to 25 years.\n   - Outliers: Several outliers extend up to around 70 years.\n\n### Insights:\n\n1. **Age Distribution Trends:**\n   - The age distribution of students who graduate and those who are currently enrolled are quite similar, with a median age of around 20 years.\n   - The dropout group has a noticeably higher median age of around 25 years, indicating that older students are more likely to drop out.\n\n2. **Variability:**\n   - The dropout group shows a wider spread in age (higher IQR and whiskers) compared to the graduate and enrolled groups, suggesting more variability in the ages of students who drop out.\n   - The graduate and enrolled groups have similar and narrower age distributions, indicating a more homogenous age group.\n\n3. **Outliers:**\n   - All groups have outliers, but they are more pronounced in the enrolled group, extending up to 70 years, indicating that there are some significantly older students still enrolled.\n   - The dropout group also has a significant number of outliers, but they are less extreme compared to the enrolled group.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe box plot indicates that age at enrollment is an important factor in understanding student outcomes. Specifically, older students are more likely to drop out, while younger students have a higher likelihood of either graduating or remaining enrolled. This insight could be useful for developing targeted interventions to support older students and reduce dropout rates.\n## IMAGE: Course_vs_Target_stacked_bar.png ##\nThe image displays a stacked bar plot depicting the distribution of student outcomes (Dropout, Enrolled, Graduate) across different course codes. The x-axis represents the different course codes, while the y-axis shows the count of students. The bars are divided into three colors: purple for Dropout, teal for Enrolled, and yellow for Graduate. Here is a detailed description of the data:\n\n### Data Distribution:\n1. **Courses with High Dropout Rates:**\n   - Course 171: Significant proportion of students are dropouts.\n   - Course 8014: Similar pattern with a notable number of dropouts.\n   - Course 9147: High dropout rate.\n   - Course 9351: Dropouts are predominant.\n   \n2. **Courses with High Enrollment Rates:**\n   - Course 8014: Noticeable number of students are still enrolled.\n   - Course 9254: Significant number of students are in the enrollment phase.\n\n3. **Courses with High Graduation Rates:**\n   - Course 9500: Most students have graduated, showing the highest count among all.\n   - Course 9065, 9119, 9238, 9773: Large proportion of students have graduated in these courses.\n\n### Insights:\n1. **Course 9500:** This course has a significantly higher number of graduates compared to others, indicating successful completion rates.\n2. **Courses 171 and 8014:** These have high dropout rates, suggesting potential issues with the course structure, difficulty, or support for students.\n3. **Mixed Outcomes:**\n   - Courses such as 9065, 9119, 9238, and 9773 show a balance between graduates and dropouts, with fewer students still enrolled.\n   - Course 9254 has a more balanced distribution across dropouts, enrolled, and graduates.\n\n### Relationships and Trends:\n- **High Graduates:** Courses with a high number of graduates (9500, 9065, 9119) might indicate effective teaching methods, better student support systems, or more motivated student populations.\n- **High Dropouts:** Courses with high dropout rates (171, 8014) could benefit from additional analysis to understand the underlying causes and implement interventions.\n- **Balanced Courses:** Courses like 8014 and 9254 with balanced outcomes across dropouts, enrollments, and graduates could be indicative of courses in transition or with varying student performance levels.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Further Investigation:** Courses with high dropout rates should be further investigated to identify and address the root causes.\n2. **Support Systems:** Implementing additional support systems in courses with high enrollment but lower graduation rates might help improve graduation rates.\n3. **Best Practices:** Courses with high graduation rates can serve as models to improve other courses, adopting their best practices and teaching methodologies.\n\nOverall, the plot provides a comprehensive overview of student outcomes across different courses, highlighting areas for potential improvement and success stories.\n## IMAGE: Curricular_units_1st_sem_(approved)_vs_Target_boxplot.png ##\nThis image displays a box plot illustrating the distribution of approved curricular units in the first semester among three distinct groups of students: Graduate, Dropout, and Enrolled. Below is a detailed description of the image and insights derived from it:\n\n### Detailed Description:\n\n**Title:** Box Plot of Curricular units 1st sem (approved) by Target\n\n**Axes:**\n- **X-axis (Target):** Represents the three categories of students: Graduate, Dropout, and Enrolled.\n- **Y-axis (Curricular units 1st sem (approved)):** Represents the number of curricular units approved in the first semester.\n\n**Box Plot Components:**\n- **Graduate:**\n  - Median (central line in the box): About 6 units.\n  - Interquartile Range (IQR, represented by the height of the box): From about 5 to 7.5 units.\n  - Whiskers (lines extending from the box): Range from about 4 to 8 units.\n  - Outliers: Values below 4 and above 8, reaching up to 12 units.\n\n- **Dropout:**\n  - Median: About 3.5 units.\n  - IQR: Extends from about 2 to 6 units.\n  - Whiskers: Range from 0 to 8 units.\n  - Outliers: Several values extend above 8, reaching up to 12 units.\n\n- **Enrolled:**\n  - Median: About 5 units.\n  - IQR: From about 4 to 7 units.\n  - Whiskers: Range from 1 to 8 units.\n  - Outliers: Values extend above 8, reaching up to 12 units.\n\n### Insights:\n\n1. **Approval Rates and Graduation:**\n   - Graduates generally have a higher median number of approved units (6 units) compared to Dropouts and Enrolled students.\n   - This suggests that students who approve more curricular units in their first semester are more likely to graduate.\n\n2. **Dropouts:**\n   - Dropouts have the lowest median approval rate (3.5 units) and the widest spread (IQR from 2 to 6 units).\n   - The presence of many outliers above the whiskers indicates that while some dropouts do approve a significant number of units, the majority approve fewer units.\n\n3. **Enrolled Students:**\n   - Enrolled students have a median approval rate of 5 units, which is between the median for Graduates and Dropouts.\n   - The spread of approved units for Enrolled students is similar to that of Graduates but slightly lower.\n\n4. **Variability:**\n   - The approval rates for Dropouts show the highest variability, as indicated by the wide IQR and the presence of many outliers.\n   - Graduates and Enrolled students have similar variability, but Graduates tend to approve more units overall.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom this box plot, we can infer that the number of approved curricular units in the first semester is a potential indicator of a student's likelihood to graduate. Students who approve more units in their first semester tend to graduate, while those who approve fewer units are more likely to drop out. This insight can be valuable for academic advisors and institutions aiming to identify at-risk students early and provide them with additional support.\n## IMAGE: Curricular_units_2nd_sem_(grade)_vs_Target_boxplot.png ##\nThis box plot visualizes the distribution of grades in curricular units during the 2nd semester, categorized by the target outcomes: Graduate, Dropout, and Enrolled. Here is a detailed description of each component:\n\n#### Graduate:\n- **Median:** The median grade for graduates is around 14.\n- **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The IQR (middle 50% of data) ranges from approximately 13 to 15.\n- **Whiskers:** The lower whisker extends down to about 10, while the upper whisker reaches up to approximately 16.\n- **Outliers:** There are several outliers above 16 and one outlier below 10, indicating a few students with grades significantly higher or lower than the general range.\n\n#### Dropout:\n- **Median:** The median grade for dropouts is around 12.\n- **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The IQR ranges from approximately 8 to 16.\n- **Whiskers:** The lower whisker extends down to about 6, while the upper whisker reaches up to approximately 18.\n- **Outliers:** There are no significant outliers beyond the whiskers, indicating a more spread distribution of grades among dropouts.\n\n#### Enrolled:\n- **Median:** The median grade for enrolled students is around 13.\n- **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The IQR ranges from approximately 12 to 14.\n- **Whiskers:** The lower whisker extends down to about 8, while the upper whisker reaches up to approximately 15.\n- **Outliers:** There are several outliers above 15 and one outlier below 8, indicating some students with significantly higher or lower grades than the general range.\n\n### Insights:\n1. **Grade Distribution:**\n   - Graduates tend to have higher and more consistent grades compared to dropouts and enrolled students. Their grades are mostly concentrated around 13 to 15.\n   - Dropouts show a wide range of grades, indicating variability in their academic performance. This could point to inconsistent engagement or other external factors affecting their performance.\n   - Enrolled students have a somewhat tighter grade distribution compared to dropouts but still show a few high and low outliers, indicating some variability in performance.\n\n2. **Performance Trends:**\n   - Higher grades are associated with graduation, as indicated by the median and IQR for graduates.\n   - Dropout students generally have lower median grades and a wider spread, suggesting that lower academic performance might be a factor in dropping out.\n\n3. **Outliers:**\n   - The presence of outliers, especially high outliers among graduates and enrolled students, suggests that while most students perform within a certain range, there are exceptional cases of both high and low performance.\n   - The single low outlier among graduates indicates that even students with lower-than-average grades can still graduate, though they are rare.\n\n4. **Academic Support:**\n   - Students with grades in the lower range of the enrolled category might benefit from additional academic support to prevent potential dropouts.\n   - Understanding the underlying reasons for the wide grade distribution among dropouts could help in designing interventions to reduce dropout rates.\n\nOverall, this box plot highlights the relationship between academic performance (grades) and student outcomes (graduate, dropout, enrolled), providing valuable insights for educational strategies and student support services.\n\n\n#############\n# REVIEW #\n{'final_suggestion': {'agent developer': 'No suggestions necessary as the agent performed excellently.', 'agent planner': 'No suggestions necessary as the agent performed excellently.'}, 'final_score': {'agent developer': 5, 'agent planner': 5}}\n"

What changes did they undergo? If any feature types were modified, answer which features are modified and how they are modified. If any features were deleted or created, answer which features are deleted or created and provide detailed explanations.**\n\n- **Involved Features:**\n  - **Numerical Features:** \n    - `Previous qualification (grade)`, `Admission grade`, `Curricular units (credited/enrolled/evaluations/approved/grade)`, `Unemployment rate`, `Inflation rate`, `GDP`, `Age at enrollment`.\n  - **Categorical Features:** \n    - `Marital status`, `Application mode`, `Course`, `Previous qualification`, `Nacionality`, `Mother's qualification`, `Father's qualification`, `Mother's occupation`, `Father's occupation`, `Displaced`, `Educational special needs`, `Debtor`, `Tuition fees up to date`, `Gender`, `Scholarship holder`, `International`, `Target`.\n\n- **Changes:**\n  - **Numerical Features:**\n    - All numerical features were ensured to be of numeric type using `pd.to_numeric()`, converting any non-numeric entries to NaN.\n  \n  - **Categorical Features:**\n    - No features were deleted or created, but value counts were generated for each categorical feature, identifying categories with low representation.\n\n---\n\n### Question 3\n**What were the main statistical characteristics and distributions observed for the numerical features?**\n\n- **Key Characteristics:**\n  - **Mean, Median, Standard Deviation**:\n    - Most features exhibited a mean and median close to each other, indicating relatively symmetric distributions.\n  - **Skewness and Kurtosis**:\n    - Most features showed low skewness and kurtosis, indicating normal-like distributions. \n  - **Outliers**:\n    - Identified in features like `Admission grade` and `Curricular units` where certain values exceeded typical ranges.\n\n---\n\n### Question 4\n**Which categorical features displayed significant class imbalances, and how might these imbalances affect model performance?**\n\n- **Significant Class Imbalances:**\n  - Features such as `Course` and `Marital status` displayed categories with less than 5% representation:\n    - For instance, certain courses had very few students, leading to potential class imbalances.\n  \n- **Impact on Model Performance:**\n  - Class imbalance can cause models to be biased towards majority classes, potentially leading to poor predictive performance for minority classes. This can affect accuracy and recall for underrepresented categories.\n\n---\n\n### Question 5\n**What correlations were identified between the numerical features and the target variable?**\n\n- **Notable Correlations:**\n  - Features like `Admission grade` showed a positive correlation with the `Target`, indicating that higher admission grades are associated with a higher likelihood of graduation.\n  - Other features also showed varying degrees of correlation, with some being statistically significant (|r| > 0.1), guiding feature selection for modeling.\n\n---\n\n### Question 6\n**What insights or patterns emerged from the exploratory analysis that could suggest new features or transformations for better model performance?**\n\n- **Insights:**\n  - **Admission Grades & Graduation:** Higher admission grades correlate with graduation, suggesting a potential threshold feature or interaction term.\n  - **Age Influence:** Older students tend to drop out more often; hence, creating age brackets could provide informative categorical features.\n  - **Curricular Units:** The number of approved curricular units shows a strong relationship with student outcomes, suggesting the potential for creating a composite feature reflecting academic engagement.\n\n--- \n\nThis comprehensive analysis of the in-depth exploratory data analysis phase provides insights that can drive feature engineering and model building efforts moving forward."
