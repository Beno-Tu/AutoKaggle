### Question 2
**Which features were involved in this phase? What changes did they undergo?**

- **Involved Features:**
  - **Categorical Features:**
    - **Binary Categorical Features:**
      - `Gender`, `Displaced`, `Debtor`, `Scholarship holder`, `International`
      - **Changes:** Encoded using `LabelEncoder`.
    - **Multiclass Categorical Features:**
      - `Marital status`, `Application mode`, `Course`, `Previous qualification`, `Nacionality`, `Mother's qualification`, `Father's qualification`, `Mother's occupation`, `Father's occupation`, `Educational special needs`, `Tuition fees up to date`
      - **Changes:** Encoded using `OneHotEncoder`.
  
  - **Numerical Features:**
    - `Previous qualification (grade)`, `Admission grade`, `Curricular units (credited/enrolled/evaluations/approved/grade)`, `Unemployment rate`, `Inflation rate`, `GDP`, `Age at enrollment`
    - **Changes:** Scaled using `StandardScaler`.

- **New Features Created:**
  - Interaction features:
    - `Admission_grade_x_GDP`
    - `Age_at_enrollment_x_Educational_special_needs`
  - Polynomial features generated from selected numerical features.

- **No features were deleted in this phase.**

### Question 3
**What categorical features were encoded, and what techniques were used for their transformation?**

- **Binary Categorical Features:**
  - Encoded using `LabelEncoder`:
    - `Gender`, `Displaced`, `Debtor`, `Scholarship holder`, `International`

- **Multiclass Categorical Features:**
  - Encoded using `OneHotEncoder`:
    - `Marital status`, `Application mode`, `Course`, `Previous qualification`, `Nacionality`, `Mother's qualification`, `Father's qualification`, `Mother's occupation`, `Father's occupation`, `Educational special needs`, `Tuition fees up to date`

### Question 4
**What numerical features were scaled or normalized, and what methods were used?**

- **Numerical Features Scaled:**
  - `Previous qualification (grade)`, `Admission grade`, `Curricular units 1st sem (credited/enrolled/evaluations/approved/grade)`, `Curricular units 2nd sem (credited/enrolled/evaluations/approved/grade)`, `Unemployment rate`, `Inflation rate`, `GDP`, `Age at enrollment`
  
- **Methods Used:**
  - `StandardScaler`: Applied z-score normalization to standardize features.

### Question 5
**What new features were created during interaction and polynomial feature generation, and how might they impact model performance?**

- **Interaction Features Created:**
  - `Admission_grade_x_GDP`: Captures the combined effect of admission grade and GDP.
  - `Age_at_enrollment_x_Educational_special_needs`: Captures the relationship between age at enrollment and educational special needs.

- **Polynomial Features:**
  - Generated polynomial features from selected numerical features.

**Impact on Model Performance:**
- These features can capture complex relationships and interactions that might improve the model's predictive power and ability to generalize.

---

### Question 6
**How were missing values handled, and what imputation strategies were implemented?**

- **Missing Values Handling:**
  - No missing values detected in either the training or test datasets after feature engineering.
  - Therefore, no imputation strategies were applied.

---

### Question 7
**Were there any features that were identified as unnecessary or redundant during the feature engineering process? If so, which ones and why?**

- **No features were identified as unnecessary or redundant** during this phase. All features were retained for model training.

---

### Question 8
**What insights or patterns were observed from the engineered features that could guide model selection or tuning in the next phase?**

- **Insights:**
  - The creation of interaction features may reveal non-linear relationships that can enhance model performance.
  - The scaling of numerical features can help in models sensitive to feature magnitudes, such as gradient-based algorithms.
  
- **Model Selection Guidance:**
  - Consider models that can capture interactions, such as tree-based methods (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) or ensemble methods, given the complexity introduced by the new features.
