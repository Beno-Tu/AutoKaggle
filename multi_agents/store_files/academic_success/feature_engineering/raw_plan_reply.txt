### Feature Engineering Plan for "classification_with_an_academic_success_dataset"

To effectively transform `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv` into `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`, the feature engineering phase will be divided into four critical tasks. Each task is tailored to enhance the predictive power of the dataset while adhering to the competition guidelines and resource constraints.

#### **Task 1: Encode Categorical Variables**

**Objective:**  
Transform all categorical features into numerical representations to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.

**Essential Actions:**

1. **Identify Categorical Features:**
   - **List of Categorical Variables:**
     - `Marital status`
     - `Application mode`
     - `Course`
     - `Previous qualification`
     - `Nationality`
     - `Mother's qualification`
     - `Father's qualification`
     - `Mother's occupation`
     - `Father's occupation`
     - `Displaced`
     - `Educational special needs`
     - `Debtor`
     - `Tuition fees up to date`
     - `Gender`
     - `Scholarship holder`
     - `International`

2. **Handle Binary Categories:**
   - **Features with Two Categories:**
     - `Gender`
     - `Displaced`
     - `Debtor`
     - `Scholarship holder`
     - `International`
   - **Method:**
     - Apply **Label Encoding**:
       - Assign `0` and `1` to the two categories respectively.
     - **Example:** `Gender` - `Male: 0`, `Female: 1`

3. **Handle Multiclass Categories:**
   - **Features with More Than Two Categories:**
     - `Marital status`
     - `Application mode`
     - `Course`
     - `Previous qualification`
     - `Nationality`
     - `Mother's qualification`
     - `Father's qualification`
     - `Mother's occupation`
     - `Father's occupation`
     - `Educational special needs`
     - `Tuition fees up to date`
   - **Method:**
     - Apply **One-Hot Encoding**:
       - Create binary columns for each category to avoid introducing ordinal relationships.
     - **Dimensionality Management:**
       - For high-cardinality features like `Course`, consider **Target Encoding** or **Frequency Encoding** to reduce the number of generated dummy variables.
     - **Example:**
       - `Marital status` might expand to `Marital_status_Single`, `Marital_status_Married`, etc.

4. **Ensure Consistent Encoding Across Train and Test Sets:**
   - **Consistency:**
     - Fit encoding schemes on `cleaned_train.csv` and apply the same transformation to `cleaned_test.csv`.
   - **Handling Unseen Categories:**
     - For **One-Hot Encoding**, use parameters like `handle_unknown='ignore'` to manage categories present in the test set but not in the training set.
     - For **Target Encoding**, assign a default value (e.g., overall target mean) to unseen categories.

**Tools and Parameters:**
- **Pandas:** For initial data manipulation and handling.
- **Scikit-learn's `LabelEncoder` and `OneHotEncoder`:**
  - `OneHotEncoder` Parameters: `handle_unknown='ignore'`, `sparse=False`
- **Category Encoders Library (if needed):**
  - For advanced encoding techniques like **Target Encoding** or **Frequency Encoding**.

**Expected Output:**
- Numerical representations of all categorical features in both `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`.
- Enhanced compatibility with machine learning models due to the elimination of non-numeric categories.

**Constraints:**
- **Dimensionality Control:**
  - Limit the number of dummy variables to prevent the curse of dimensionality, especially for high-cardinality features.
- **Data Leakage Prevention:**
  - Ensure that encoding schemes are exclusively based on the training data to avoid introducing information from the test set.

     - **Example:**
       - If `GDP` is right-skewed, apply log transformation: `log(GDP + 1)` to handle zero values.

4. **Apply Scaling Techniques:**
   - **Standard Scaling (Z-score Normalization):**
     - Centers the data around the mean with unit variance.
     - Suitable for algorithms that assume normal distribution (e.g., Linear Regression, SVM).
   - **Min-Max Scaling:**
     - Scales features to a specific range, typically `[0, 1]`.
     - Useful for algorithms sensitive to the scale of data (e.g., Neural Networks).
   - **Selection Criteria:**
     - Choose **Standard Scaling** if features are approximately normally distributed.
     - Choose **Min-Max Scaling** if features have a bounded range or if algorithms require scaled input.

5. **Ensure Consistency Between Train and Test Sets:**
   - **Procedure:**
     - Fit the scaler on `processed_train.csv` to compute the necessary statistics.
     - Apply the same scaler to `processed_test.csv` using the fitted parameters to maintain consistency.

**Tools and Parameters:**
- **Scikit-learn's `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler`:**
  - `StandardScaler`: No parameters needed for basic scaling.
  - `MinMaxScaler` Parameters: `feature_range=(0, 1)`
- **Scikit-learn's `PowerTransformer`:**
  - For **Box-Cox** or **Yeo-Johnson** transformations.
  - Parameters: `method='yeo-johnson'`, `standardize=True`

**Expected Output:**
- Scaled and/or transformed numerical features in both `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`.
- Reduced impact of outliers and skewness, leading to more stable and efficient model training.

**Constraints:**
- **Avoid Information Leakage:**
  - Fit transformation parameters solely on the training data.
- **Numerical Stability:**
  - Ensure that transformations do not introduce numerical issues, such as extremely large or small values.

#### **Task 3: Create Interaction and Polynomial Features**

**Objective:**  
Enhance the feature space by introducing interaction terms and polynomial features that may capture underlying patterns and relationships, potentially improving model performance.

**Essential Actions:**

1. **Identify Potential Interaction Pairs:**
   - **Domain Knowledge-Based Selection:**
     - Use insights from the previous report to select feature pairs that may interact meaningfully.
     - **Examples:**
       - `Admission grade` × `GDP` (economic influence on admission success)

     - **Example:**
       - `Admission_grade_squared = Admission_grade ** 2`
   
4. **Evaluate Feature Importance:**
   - **Objective:**
     - Assess the significance of newly created features to determine their contribution to the model.
   - **Actions:**
     - Perform correlation analysis between new features and the `Target`.
     - Utilize feature importance metrics from preliminary models (e.g., feature importance from Random Forest).
     - Remove interaction or polynomial features that do not show meaningful contributions (e.g., low correlation coefficients).

**Tools and Parameters:**
- **Scikit-learn's `PolynomialFeatures`:**
  - Parameters: `degree=2`, `interaction_only=False`, `include_bias=False`
- **Pandas:** For manual creation of specific interaction terms if necessary.
