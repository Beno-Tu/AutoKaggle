**Numerical Features for Polynomial Terms:**\n    - `Admission grade`\n    - `GDP`\n    - `Age at enrollment`\n    - Any other numerical features identified with non-linear relationships to the target.\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- Introduction of new features that capture interactions and non-linear relationships, potentially enhancing the model's ability to learn complex patterns.\n- A richer feature set that may lead to improved predictive performance and accuracy.\n\nConstraints:\n- **Dimensionality Control:** Limit the number of generated interaction and polynomial features to prevent overfitting and manage computational complexity.\n- **Resource Management:** Ensure that feature creation does not excessively increase the dataset size, adhering to runtime and efficiency constraints.\n- **Relevance Assessment:** Only retain interaction and polynomial features that show meaningful contributions to the target variable based on feature importance evaluations.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 4\nTask: Handle Missing Values and Impute Derived Features  \nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:**\n  - Scikit-learn's `SimpleImputer` with strategies like `mean`, `median`, or `most_frequent` for imputing missing values.\n  - Pandas for creating indicator variables and handling data transformations.\n- **Involved Features:**\n  - **All Features After Encoding and Scaling:**\n    - This includes both original and newly created interaction or polynomial features.\n  \nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- Fully imputed datasets (`processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`) with no missing values, ensuring data integrity during model training.\n- Enhanced feature robustness by addressing missing data comprehensively, which can lead to more stable and reliable model performance.\n\nConstraints:\n- **Avoid Information Leakage:** Fit imputers solely on the training data and apply the same imputation strategy to both training and test sets.\n- **Consistent Imputation:** Ensure that the imputation methods are applied uniformly across both datasets to maintain alignment.\n- **Indicator Variables:** For features with substantial missing data, create binary indicators to inform the model about the presence of missingness without introducing bias.\n\n---\n\n#############\n# CODE AND OUTPUT #\n## CODE ##\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder\nfrom sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n\n# Define directories\nDATA_DIR = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/classification_with_an_academic_success_dataset/'\nFEATURE_ENGINEERING_DIR = DATA_DIR + 'feature_engineering/'\nIMAGE_DIR = FEATURE_ENGINEERING_DIR + 'images/'\n\n# Create directories if they don't exist\nPath(FEATURE_ENGINEERING_DIR).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\nPath(IMAGE_DIR).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n\n# Load cleaned data\ncleaned_train_path = DATA_DIR + 'cleaned_train.csv'\ncleaned_test_path = DATA_DIR + 'cleaned_test.csv'\n\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv(cleaned_train_path)\ntest_df = pd.read_csv(cleaned_test_path)\n\n# Make copies to avoid modifying original data\nprocessed_train_df = train_df.copy()\nprocessed_test_df = test_df.copy()\n\n# Define categorical features\nbinary_categorical_features = [\n    'Gender',\n    'Displaced',\n    'Debtor',\n    'Scholarship holder',\n    'International'\n]\n\nmulticlass_categorical_features = [\n    'Marital status',\n    'Application mode',\n    'Course',\n    'Previous qualification',\n    'Nacionality',\n    \"Mother's qualification\",\n    \"Father's qualification\",\n    \"Mother's occupation\",\n    \"Father's occupation\",\n    'Educational special needs',\n    'Tuition fees up to date'\n]\n\n# Initialize LabelEncoders for binary features\nlabel_encoders = {}\nfor col in binary_categorical_features:\n    le = LabelEncoder()\n    combined_data = pd.concat([processed_train_df[col], processed_test_df[col]], axis=0).astype(str)\n    le.fit(combined_data)\n    processed_train_df[col] = le.transform(processed_train_df[col].astype(str))\n    processed_test_df[col] = le.transform(processed_test_df[col].astype(str))\n    label_encoders[col] = le\n\nprint(\"Binary categorical features encoded successfully.\")\n\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, PowerTransformer\n\n# Define numerical features to scale/normalize\nnumerical_features = [\n    'Previous qualification (grade)',\n    'Admission grade',\n    'Curricular units 1st sem (credited)',\n    'Curricular units 1st sem (enrolled)',\n    'Curricular units 1st sem (evaluations)',\n    'Curricular units 1st sem (approved)',\n    'Curricular units 1st sem (grade)',\n    'Curricular units 1st sem (without evaluations)',\n    'Curricular units 2nd sem (credited)',\n    'Curricular units 2nd sem (enrolled)',\n    'Curricular units 2nd sem (evaluations)',\n    'Curricular units 2nd sem (approved)',\n    'Curricular units 2nd sem (grade)',\n    'Curricular units 2nd sem (without evaluations)',\n    'Unemployment rate',\n    'Inflation rate',\n    'GDP',\n    'Age at enrollment'\n]\n\n# Ensure all numerical features exist in the data\nnumerical_features = [col for col in numerical_features if col in processed_train_df.columns]\n\n# Initialize scalers\nstandard_scaler = StandardScaler()\nminmax_scaler = MinMaxScaler()\npower_transformer = PowerTransformer(method='yeo-johnson')\n\n# Choose a scaler based on feature distribution\n# For simplicity, we'll use StandardScaler here.
