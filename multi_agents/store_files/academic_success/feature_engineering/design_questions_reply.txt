Here are six key questions designed to summarize the findings from the Feature Engineering phase and provide guidance for the upcoming Model Building, Validation, and Prediction phase:

### Key Questions

1. **What categorical features were encoded, and what techniques were used for their transformation?**
   - **Purpose:** This question helps summarize the encoding methods applied to categorical variables, ensuring the planner understands how these features are represented in the dataset, which is crucial for model input.

2. **What numerical features were scaled or normalized, and what methods were used?**
   - **Purpose:** Understanding which numerical features underwent scaling or normalization and the techniques employed will aid in assessing the data's readiness for modeling and help in choosing appropriate models that require specific feature scaling.

3. **What new features were created during interaction and polynomial feature generation, and how might they impact model performance?**
   - **Purpose:** This question focuses on the new features added to the dataset, emphasizing the potential complexity they introduce and their expected contributions to improving model accuracy.

4. **How were missing values handled, and what imputation strategies were implemented?**
   - **Purpose:** Identifying how missing data was addressed provides insights into the completeness of the dataset and informs decisions regarding model robustness and the handling of similar issues in future phases.

5. **Were there any features that were identified as unnecessary or redundant during the feature engineering process? If so, which ones and why?**
   - **Purpose:** This question assists in understanding feature selection and dimensionality reduction, which is critical in ensuring that the model does not overfit and performs optimally.

6. **What insights or patterns were observed from the engineered features that could guide model selection or tuning in the next phase?**
   - **Purpose:** Encouraging reflection on the findings from feature engineering can lead to informed decisions regarding the choice of modeling techniques and hyperparameter tuning strategies, maximizing the chances of achieving high accuracy.

These questions are designed to ensure a comprehensive summary of the Feature Engineering phase, while also providing actionable insights for the next phase of Model Building, Validation, and Prediction.
