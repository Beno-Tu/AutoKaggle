status`, `Application mode`, `Course`, `Previous qualification`, `Nationality`, `Mother's qualification`, `Father's qualification`, `Mother's occupation`, `Father's occupation`, `Displaced`, `Educational special needs`, `Debtor`, `Tuition fees up to date`, `Gender`, `Scholarship holder`, `International`\n      - Method: `mode`\n  - `remove_columns_with_missing_data`\n    - **Parameters:** \n      - `thresh`: `0.6` (remove columns with more than 60% missing values)\n- **Features Involved:** All features in both `train.csv` and `test.csv`\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- Datasets (`cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`) with missing values imputed appropriately.\n- Removal of columns with excessive missing values (above 60%), reducing noise and potential biases.\n\nConstraints:\n- Prevent introduction of significant bias through imputation.\n- Maintain consistency in handling missing values across both training and test datasets to avoid data leakage.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 2\nTask: **Detect and Handle Outliers in Numerical Features**\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:**\n  - `detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr`\n    -
