Certainly! Below is a comprehensive **Data Cleaning Plan** tailored specifically to your current phase in the "classification_with_an_academic_success_dataset" competition. This plan is structured into **four key tasks**, each focusing on critical aspects of data cleaning to transform `train.csv` and `test.csv` into `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`.

---

## **Data Cleaning Plan**

### **Task 1: Handle Missing Values**

**Objective:**  
Identify and appropriately handle missing values in both `train.csv` and `test.csv` to ensure data completeness and integrity.

**Actions:**

1. **Identify Missing Values:**
   - **Objective:** Determine which columns contain missing values and quantify the extent of missingness.
   - **Features Involved:** All features in both datasets.
   - **Method:** Utilize pandas' `isnull()` and `sum()` functions to calculate the percentage of missing values per column.

2. **Assess Missingness Threshold:**
   - **Objective:** Decide whether to impute or remove columns based on the proportion of missing values.
   - **Constraint:** Columns with missingness above a specified threshold (e.g., 40%) will be flagged for removal.

3. **Impute Missing Values:**
   - **Objective:** Fill missing values in columns below the removal threshold to retain as much data as possible.
   - **Features Involved:**
     - **Numerical Features:** `Previous qualification (grade)`, `Admission grade`, `Curricular units (...)`, `Unemployment rate`, `Inflation rate`, `GDP`
     - **Categorical Features:** `Marital status`, `Application mode`, `Course`, `Previous qualification`, `Nationality`, `Mother's qualification`, `Father's qualification`, `Mother's occupation`, `Father's occupation`, `Displaced`, `Educational special needs`, `Debtor`, `Tuition fees up to date`, `Gender`, `Scholarship holder`, `International`
   - **Method:**
     - **Numerical Columns:** Use the `fill_missing_values` tool with the `median` method to mitigate the influence of outliers.
     - **Categorical Columns:** Use the `fill_missing_values` tool with the `mode` method to replace missing entries with the most frequent category.

4. **Remove Columns with Excessive Missing Values:**
   - **Objective:** Eliminate columns that have a high proportion of missing values to reduce noise and potential biases.
   - **Features Involved:** Columns identified in the missingness threshold assessment.
   - **Method:** Apply the `remove_columns_with_missing_data` tool with a `thresh` parameter set to `0.6` (i.e., columns with more than 60% missing values will be removed).

**Tools to Use:**
- `fill_missing_values`
- `remove_columns_with_missing_data`
- **Libraries:** Pandas

**Expected Output:**
- Datasets (`cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`) with no missing values below the defined thresholds.
- Reduced number of columns by removing those with excessive missingness.

**Constraints:**
- Ensure that imputation does not introduce significant bias, especially in target-related features.
- Maintain consistency in handling missing values across both training and test datasets to avoid data leakage.

### **Task 2: Detect and Handle Outliers in Numerical Features**

**Objective:**  
Identify and manage outliers in numerical features to enhance model robustness and performance.

**Actions:**

1. **Identify Outliers Using the IQR Method:**
   - **Objective:** Detect outliers without assuming a specific data distribution.
   - **Features Involved:** All numerical features:
     - `Previous qualification (grade)`
     - `Admission grade`
     - `Curricular units 1st sem (...)`
     - `Curricular units 2nd sem (...)`
     - `Unemployment rate`
     - `Inflation rate`
     - `GDP`
   - **Method:** Apply the `detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr` tool with a `factor` of `1.5` to identify outliers in each numerical column.

2. **Handle Detected Outliers:**
   - **Objective:** Mitigate the impact of outliers on the modeling process.
   - **Method:** Use the `clip` method within the `detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr` tool to cap outlier values at the upper and lower bounds calculated from the IQR. This approach preserves the data entries while reducing the severity of outliers.

**Tools to Use:**
- `detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr`
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy

**Expected Output:**
- Numerical features in both datasets with outliers capped, reducing their influence on the model.

**Constraints:**
- Avoid removing outliers from the test dataset to prevent discrepancies between training and prediction phases.
- Ensure that clipping preserves the overall data distribution and does not artificially compress feature ranges.

### **Task 3: Normalize and Standardize Categorical Features**

**Objective:**  
Ensure consistency and uniformity in categorical features to prevent issues during model training and evaluation.

**Actions:**

1. **Standardize Categorical Values:**
   - **Objective:** Resolve inconsistencies such as case sensitivity, leading/trailing spaces, and typos in categorical features.
   - **Features Involved:** All categorical features:
     - `Marital status`
     - `Application mode`
     - `Course`
     - `Previous qualification`
     - `Nationality`
     - `Mother's qualification`
     - `Father's qualification`
     - `Mother's occupation`
     - `Father's occupation`
     - `Displaced`
     - `Educational special needs`
     - `Debtor`
     - `Tuition fees up to date`
     - `Gender`
     - `Scholarship holder`
     - `International`
   - **Method:** Utilize pandas string methods to:
     - Convert all categorical strings to lowercase.
     - Strip leading and trailing whitespaces.
     - Correct common typos based on predefined mappings or manual inspection.

2. **Ensure Consistent Data Types:**
   - **Objective:** Convert all categorical features to a uniform data type (`string`) to facilitate downstream processing.
   - **Method:** Apply the `convert_data_types` tool to set the `target_type` to `str` for all categorical columns.

**Tools to Use:**
- `convert_data_types`
- **Libraries:** Pandas

**Expected Output:**
- Categorical features with standardized and consistent formatting across both datasets, eliminating discrepancies.

**Constraints:**
- Maintain the integrity of category names to avoid merging distinct categories inadvertently.
- Ensure that the standardization process does not alter the semantic meaning of categories.

### **Task 4: Remove Duplicate Rows and Convert Data Types**

**Objective:**  
Eliminate redundant data entries and ensure all features have appropriate data types to maintain dataset quality.

**Actions:**

1. **Remove Duplicate Entries:**
   - **Objective:** Identify and remove duplicate rows that may skew the analysis and model training.
   - **Features Involved:** All features, with a particular focus on ensuring that the `id` remains unique.
   - **Method:**
     - Apply the `remove_duplicates` tool using all columns except `id` to identify duplicates.
     - Set the `keep` parameter to `first` to retain the first occurrence of duplicated rows.
     - Ensure that the `id` column remains unique by not considering it in the duplication criteria.

2. **Convert Data Types Appropriately:**
   - **Objective:** Ensure that each feature has the correct data type to facilitate accurate analysis and modeling.
   - **Features Involved:**
     - **Numerical Features:** Confirm they are of type `int` or `float` as appropriate.
     - **Categorical Features:** Ensure they are of type `str`.
     - **ID Feature:** Keep as type `str` to preserve leading zeros or specific formatting.
   - **Method:** Use the `convert_data_types` tool to:
     - Set numerical columns to `float` or `int`.
     - Confirm categorical columns are `str`.
     - Verify that the `id` column is `str` to maintain consistency.

**Tools to Use:**
- `remove_duplicates`
- `convert_data_types`
- **Libraries:** Pandas

**Expected Output:**
- Datasets free from duplicate rows, ensuring each `id` is unique.
- All features possess appropriate and consistent data types, ready for subsequent analysis and modeling phases.

**Constraints:**
- Preserve the unique identifier (`id`) for each student to maintain traceability.
- Avoid altering data types in ways that could lead to loss of information (e.g., converting `id` to numerical types that might remove leading zeros).
