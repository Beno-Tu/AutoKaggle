This approach preserves the data entries while reducing the severity of outliers.\n\n**Tools to Use:**\n- `detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr`\n- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy\n\n**Expected Output:**\n- Numerical features in both datasets with outliers capped, reducing their influence on the model.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Avoid removing outliers from the test dataset to prevent discrepancies between training and prediction phases.\n- Ensure that clipping preserves the overall data distribution and does not artificially compress feature ranges.\n\n---\n\n### **Task 3: Normalize and Standardize Categorical Features**\n\n**Objective:**  \nEnsure consistency and uniformity in categorical features to prevent issues during model training and evaluation.\n\n**Actions:**\n\n1. **Standardize Categorical Values:**\n   - **Objective:** Resolve inconsistencies such as case sensitivity, leading/trailing spaces, and typos in categorical features.\n   - **Features Involved:** All categorical features:\n     - `Marital status`\n     - `Application mode`\n     - `Course`\n     - `Previous qualification`\n     - `Nationality`\n     - `Mother's qualification`\n     - `Father's qualification`\n     - `Mother's occupation`\n     - `Father's occupation`\n     - `Displaced`\n     - `Educational special needs`\n     - `Debtor`\n     - `Tuition fees up to date`\n     - `Gender`\n     - `Scholarship holder`\n     - `International`\n   - **Method:** Utilize pandas string methods to:\n     - Convert all categorical strings to lowercase.\n     - Strip leading and trailing whitespaces.\n     - Correct common typos based on predefined mappings or manual inspection.\n\n2. **Ensure Consistent Data Types:**\n   - **Objective:** Convert all categorical features to a uniform data type (`string`) to facilitate downstream processing.\n   - **Method:** Apply the `convert_data_types` tool to set the `target_type` to `str` for all categorical columns.\n\n**Tools to Use:**\n- `convert_data_types`\n- **Libraries:** Pandas\n\n**Expected Output:**\n- Categorical features with standardized and consistent formatting across both datasets, eliminating discrepancies.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Maintain the integrity of category names to avoid merging distinct categories inadvertently.\n- Ensure that the standardization process does not alter the semantic meaning of categories.\n\n---\n\n### **Task 4: Remove Duplicate Rows and Convert Data Types**\n\n**Objective:**  \nEliminate redundant data entries and ensure all features have appropriate data types to maintain dataset quality.\n\n**Actions:**\n\n1. **Remove Duplicate Entries:**\n   - **Objective:** Identify and remove duplicate rows that may skew the analysis and model training.\n   - **Features Involved:** All features, with a particular focus on ensuring that the `id` remains unique.\n   - **Method:**\n     - Apply the `remove_duplicates` tool using all columns except `id` to identify duplicates.\n     - Set the `keep` parameter to `first` to retain the first occurrence of duplicated rows.\n     - Ensure that the `id` column remains unique by not considering it in the duplication criteria.\n\n2. **Convert Data Types Appropriately:**\n   - **Objective:** Ensure that each feature has the correct data type to facilitate accurate analysis and modeling.\n   - **Features Involved:**\n     - **Numerical Features:** Confirm they are of type `int` or `float` as appropriate.\n     - **Categorical Features:** Ensure they are of type `str`.\n     - **ID Feature:** Keep as type `str` to preserve leading zeros or specific formatting.\n   - **Method:** Use the `convert_data_types` tool to:\n     - Set numerical columns to `float` or `int`.\n     - Confirm categorical columns are `str`.\n     - Verify that the `id` column is `str` to maintain consistency.\n\n**Tools to Use:**\n- `remove_duplicates`\n- `convert_data_types`\n- **Libraries:** Pandas\n\n**Expected Output:**\n- Datasets free from duplicate rows, ensuring each `id` is unique.\n- All features possess appropriate and consistent data types, ready for subsequent analysis and modeling phases.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Preserve the unique identifier (`id`) for each student to maintain traceability.\n- Avoid altering data types in ways that could lead to loss of information (e.g., converting `id` to numerical types that might remove leading zeros).\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of Tools and Libraries Utilized**\n\n- **Custom Tools:**\n  - `fill_missing_values`\n  - `remove_columns_with_missing_data`\n  - `detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr`\n  - `convert_data_types`\n  - `remove_duplicates`\n\n- **Public Libraries:**\n  - **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.\n  - **NumPy:** For numerical operations.\n\n---\n\n## **Implementation Notes**\n\n- **Consistency Across Datasets:** Ensure that all data cleaning steps are applied uniformly to both `train.csv` and `test.csv` to maintain consistency and prevent data leakage.\n\n- **Documentation:** Keep detailed records of all data cleaning actions performed, including parameters used (e.g., IQR factor, missingness thresholds) to facilitate reproducibility and future reference.\n\n- **Validation:** After each task, perform validation checks to confirm that the cleaning steps have been executed correctly. For instance, verify that missing values have been appropriately filled or removed, and that outliers have been handled as intended.\n\n- **Performance Considerations:** Given the dataset sizes (`train.csv`: 76,518 rows; `test.csv`: 51,012 rows), optimize operations for efficiency. Utilize vectorized operations provided by pandas and avoid unnecessary computations to ensure timely execution.\n\n---\n\nBy following this structured **Data Cleaning Plan**, you will systematically address key data quality issues, laying a solid foundation for the subsequent phases of your data science competition. This approach ensures that your datasets are clean, consistent, and ready for in-depth analysis, feature engineering, and model building."

Data Loading:\n   - Always load data files from the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/classification_with_an_academic_success_dataset/` directory.\n   - Use specific files for each phase:\n     - Data Cleaning: `train.csv` and `test.csv`\n     - Feature Engineering: `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`\n     - Model Building, Validation, and Prediction: `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`\n\n2. Data Saving:\n   - Save image files in the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/classification_with_an_academic_success_dataset/data_cleaning/images/` directory.\n   - Save data files in the `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/classification_with_an_academic_success_dataset/` directory.\n   - Use clear, meaningful names for image files that reflect their content.\n   - Do NOT use special characters like `/` or spaces in file names.\n   - Save specific files for each phase:\n     - Data Cleaning: `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`\n     - Feature Engineering: `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`\n\n3. Data Processing:\n   - Always work on a copy of the DataFrame, not the original.\n   - Ensure correct data types for all columns before any operations.\n   - Apply consistent modifications (e.g., scaling, encoding) to both training and test sets.\n   - Take care with target-dependent operations on the test set, which lacks the target variable.\n   - Do NOT modify Id-type columns.\n\n## CODING PRACTICES ##\n1. General Rules:\n   - Use `print()` for outputting values.\n   - Avoid writing `assert` statements.\n\n2. Visualization:\n   - Use `plt.close()` after saving each image.\n   - Limit EDA visualizations to 10 or fewer, focusing on the most insightful.\n   - Optimize for large datasets (e.g., `annot=False` in seaborn heatmaps).\n\n3. Efficiency:\n   - Prioritize runtime efficiency, especially for:\n     - Data visualization\n     - Large dataset handling\n     - Complex algorithms\n\n## EXAMPLES ##\n- Before calculating a correlation matrix, ensure all data is numerical. Handle non-numerical data appropriately.\n- Verify consistent data types across columns before merging or joining operations.\n\nRemember: Always consider resource constraints and prioritize efficiency in your code.\n"

                    "content": "Thank you for providing the detailed information and specifying the constraints and tools available for the Data Cleaning phase. Below is the comprehensive solution for **Phase 3: Data Cleaning**, structured into four tasks as per your plan. Each task includes the thought process, corresponding code, and an explanation.\n\n---\n\n## TASK 1:\n**Handle Missing Values**\n\n### THOUGHT PROCESS:\nThe first step in data cleaning is to handle missing values to ensure data integrity and improve model performance. This involves:\n1. **Filling Missing Values:**\n   - **Numerical Features:** Use the median to fill missing values as it is robust against outliers.\n   - **Categorical Features:** Use the mode (most frequent value) to fill missing values.\n2. **Removing Columns with Excessive Missing Data:**\n   - Drop any column that has more than 60% missing values to reduce noise and potential biases.\n\nEnsure that both training and test datasets undergo the same processing to maintain consistency and prevent data leakage.\n\n### CODE:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Define the data directories\nDATA_DIR = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/classification_with_an_academic_success_dataset/'\nCLEANED_DATA_DIR = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/classification_with_an_academic_success_dataset/'\n\n# Load the datasets\ntrain_path = DATA_DIR + 'train.csv'\ntest_path = DATA_DIR + 'test.csv'\n\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv(train_path)\ntest_df = pd.read_csv(test_path)\n\n# Create copies to avoid modifying original data\ncleaned_train_df = train_df.copy()\ncleaned_test_df = test_df.copy()\n\n# Define numerical and categorical columns\nnumerical_cols = [\n    'Previous qualification (grade)', 'Admission grade',\n    'Curricular units 1st sem (credited)', 'Curricular units 1st sem (enrolled)',\n    'Curricular units 1st sem (evaluations)', 'Curricular units 1st sem (approved)',\n    'Curricular units 1st sem (grade)', 'Curricular units 1st sem (without evaluations)',\n    'Curricular units 2nd sem (credited)', 'Curricular units 2nd sem (enrolled)',\n    'Curricular units 2nd sem (evaluations)', 'Curricular units 2nd sem (approved)',\n    'Curricular units 2nd sem (grade)', 'Curricular units 2nd sem (without evaluations)',\n    'Unemployment rate', 'Inflation rate', 'GDP'\n]\n\ncategorical_cols = [\n    'Marital status', 'Application mode', 'Course', 'Previous qualification',\n    'Nacionality', \"Mother's qualification\", \"Father's qualification\",\n    \"Mother's occupation\", \"Father's occupation\", 'Displaced',\n    'Educational special needs', 'Debtor', 'Tuition fees up to date',\n    'Gender', 'Scholarship holder', 'International'\n]\n\n# Task 1: Fill Missing Values\n\n# Fill missing numerical features with median\ncleaned_train_df = fill_missing_values(\n    data=cleaned_train_df,\n    columns=numerical_cols,\n    method='median'\n)\ncleaned_test_df = fill_missing_values(\n    data=cleaned_test_df,\n    columns=numerical_cols,\n    method='median'\n)\n\n# Fill missing categorical features with mode\ncleaned_train_df = fill_missing_values(\n    data=cleaned_train_df,\n    columns=categorical_cols,\n    method='mode'\n)\ncleaned_test_df = fill_missing_values(\n    data=cleaned_test_df,\n    columns=categorical_cols,\n    method='mode'\n)\n\n# Remove columns with more than 60% missing values\ncleaned_train_df = remove_columns_with_missing_data(\n    data=cleaned_train_df,\n    thresh=0.6\n)\ncleaned_test_df = remove_columns_with_missing_data(\n    data=cleaned_test_df,\n    thresh=0.6\n)\n\n# Save the cleaned datasets for verification (optional)\n# cleaned_train_df.to_csv(CLEANED_DATA_DIR + 'cleaned_train_step1.csv', index=False)\n# cleaned_test_df.to_csv(CLEANED_DATA_DIR + 'cleaned_test_step1.csv', index=False)\n```\n\n### EXPLANATION:\n- **Data Loading:** The training and test datasets are loaded from the specified directory and copied to `cleaned_train_df` and `cleaned_test_df` to prevent altering the original data.\n  \n- **Defining Columns:** Lists of numerical and categorical columns are defined based on the provided feature information.\n  \n- **Filling Missing Values:**\n  - The `fill_missing_values` tool is used to impute missing values in numerical columns with the median and in categorical columns with the mode. This ensures that the central tendency of the data is preserved without introducing significant bias.\n  \n- **Removing Columns with Excessive Missing Data:**\n  - The `remove_columns_with_missing_data` tool removes any columns that have more than 60% missing values (`thresh=0.6`). This step helps in eliminating features that may not provide reliable information for modeling.\n\n---\n\n## TASK 2:\n**Detect and Handle Outliers in Numerical Features**\n\n### THOUGHT PROCESS:\nOutliers can skew the data distribution and adversely affect model performance. Using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method:\n- **Detection:** Identify outliers that lie beyond 1.5 times the IQR from the first and third quartiles.\n- **Handling:** Apply the 'clip' method to cap the outlier values at the upper and lower bounds determined by the IQR. This approach retains the data points while minimizing the impact of extreme values.\n\nEnsure that outlier handling is applied consistently to both training and test datasets to maintain uniformity.\n\n### CODE:\n```python\n# Task 2: Detect and Handle Outliers in Numerical Features\n\n# Define the numerical columns again in case some were removed in Task 1\nnumerical_cols = [\n    'Previous qualification (grade)', 'Admission grade',\n    'Curricular units 1st sem (credited)', 'Curricular units 1st sem (enrolled)',\n    'Curricular units 1st sem (evaluations)', 'Curricular units 1st sem (approved)',\n    'Curricular units 1st sem (grade)', 'Curricular units 1st sem (without evaluations)',\n    'Curricular units 2nd sem (credited)', 'Curricular units 2nd sem (enrolled)',\n    'Curricular units 2nd sem (evaluations)', 'Curricular units 2nd sem (approved)',\n    'Curricular units 2nd sem (grade)', 'Curricular units 2nd sem (without evaluations)',\n    'Unemployment rate', 'Inflation rate', 'GDP'\n]\n\n# Handle possible removal of some numerical columns in Task 1\nnumerical_cols = [col for col in numerical_cols if col in cleaned_train_df.columns]\n\n# Detect and handle outliers by clipping\ncleaned_train_df = detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr(\n    data=cleaned_train_df,\n    columns=numerical_cols,\n    factor=1.5,\n    method='clip'\n)\n\ncleaned_test_df = detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr(\n    data=cleaned_test_df,\n    columns=numerical_cols,\n    factor=1.5,\n    method='clip'\n)\n\n# Save the cleaned datasets for verification (optional)\n# cleaned_train_df.to_csv(CLEANED_DATA_DIR + 'cleaned_train_step2.csv', index=False)\n# cleaned_test_df.to_csv(CLEANED_DATA_DIR + 'cleaned_test_step2.csv', index=False)\n```\n\n### EXPLANATION:\n- **Defining Numerical Columns:** After removing columns with excessive missing data in Task 1, some numerical columns might have been dropped. Therefore, the list `numerical_cols` is updated to include only those columns that still exist in the cleaned datasets.\n  \n- **Outlier Detection and Handling:**\n  - The `detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr` tool is applied with `factor=1.5` and `method='clip'`. This caps the outlier values at the calculated lower and upper bounds based on the IQR, effectively reducing the impact of extreme values while retaining all data points.\n  \n- **Consistency:** The same processing is applied to both training and test datasets to maintain consistency and avoid discrepancies during model training and prediction.\n\n---\n\n## TASK 3:\n**Normalize and Standardize Categorical Features**\n\n### THOUGHT PROCESS:\nStandardizing categorical features ensures consistency in data formatting, which is crucial for accurate modeling and analysis. The steps include:\n1. **Data Type Conversion:** Convert all categorical columns to string type using the `convert_data_types` tool.\n2. **String Normalization:**\n   - Convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.\n   - Strip leading and trailing whitespaces to remove unintended spaces.\n   - Correct common typos based on predefined mappings or manual inspection (requires predefined mappings; assuming a placeholder for this step).\n\nMaintaining the semantic integrity of categorical variables is essential to prevent merging distinct categories inadvertently.\n\n### CODE:\n```python\n# Task 3: Normalize and Standardize Categorical Features\n\n# Define categorical columns again in case some were removed in Task 1\ncategorical_cols = [\n    'Marital status', 'Application mode', 'Course', 'Previous qualification',\n    'Nacionality', \"Mother's qualification\", \"Father's qualification\",\n    \"Mother's occupation\", \"Father's occupation\", 'Displaced',\n    'Educational special needs', 'Debtor', 'Tuition fees up to date',\n    'Gender', 'Scholarship holder', 'International'\n]\n\n# Handle possible removal of some categorical columns in Task 1\ncategorical_cols = [col for col in categorical_cols if col in cleaned_train_df.columns]\n\n# Convert categorical columns to string type\ncleaned_train_df = convert_data_types(\n    data=cleaned_train_df,\n    columns=categorical_cols,\n    target_type='str'\n)\n\ncleaned_test_df = convert_data_types(\n    data=cleaned_test_df,\n    columns=categorical_cols,\n    target_type='str'\n)\n\n# Normalize categorical strings: lowercase and strip whitespaces\nfor col in categorical_cols:\n    cleaned_train_df[col] = cleaned_train_df[col].str.lower().str.strip()\n    cleaned_test_df[col] = cleaned_test_df[col].str.lower().str.strip()\n\n# Placeholder for correcting common typos\n# Define a dictionary for typo corrections if available\n# Example:\n# typo_mapping = {\n#     'marial status': 'marital status',\n#     'scholarship holder': 'scholarship_holder',\n#     # Add more mappings as identified\n# }\n\n# Uncomment and modify the following lines if typo mappings are available\n# for col, mapping in typo_mapping.items():\n#     cleaned_train_df[col] = cleaned_train_df[col].replace(mapping)\n#     cleaned_test_df[col] = cleaned_test_df[col].replace(mapping)\n\n# Save the cleaned datasets for verification (optional)\n# cleaned_train_df.to_csv(CLEANED_DATA_DIR + 'cleaned_train_step3.csv', index=False)\n# cleaned_test_df.to_csv(CLEANED_DATA_DIR + 'cleaned_test_step3.csv', index=False)\n```\n\n### EXPLANATION:\n- **Defining Categorical Columns:** Similar to numerical columns, categorical columns might have been removed in Task 1. The list `categorical_cols` is updated accordingly.\n  \n- **Data Type Conversion:** The `convert_data_types` tool ensures that all categorical columns are of string type (`str`), which is essential for string operations.\n  \n- **String Normalization:**\n  - **Lowercasing:** Converts all text to lowercase to eliminate case sensitivity issues.\n  - **Stripping Whitespaces:** Removes any leading or trailing spaces that might cause discrepancies.\n  \n- **Typo Correction:** While the plan mentions correcting common typos, specific mappings are required. A placeholder is provided where predefined typo mappings can be applied. This step ensures that similar categories with typos are standardized, preventing the merging of distinct categories unintentionally.\n\n---\n\n## TASK 4:\n**Remove Duplicate Rows and Convert Data Types**\n\n### THOUGHT PROCESS:\nEnsuring the uniqueness of each record is vital to maintain data quality. This task involves:\n1. **Removing Duplicates:**\n   - Identify and remove duplicate rows based on all columns except the `id` to preserve the unique identifier.\n   - Retain the first occurrence of each duplicate.\n2. **Converting Data Types:**\n   - **Numerical Columns:** Ensure they are of type `int` or `float` as appropriate.\n   - **Categorical Columns:** Ensure they remain as `str`.\n   - **ID Column:** Convert to `str` to preserve formatting and prevent issues like the removal of leading zeros.\n\nThese steps enhance data integrity and prepare the dataset for subsequent analysis and modeling.\n\n### CODE:\n```python\n# Task 4: Remove Duplicate Rows and Convert Data Types\n\n# Remove duplicates based on all columns except 'id'\ncolumns_to_consider = [col for col in cleaned_train_df.columns if col != 'id']\ncleaned_train_df = remove_duplicates(\n    data=cleaned_train_df,\n    columns=columns_to_consider,\n    keep='first'\n)\n\ncleaned_test_df = remove_duplicates(\n    data=cleaned_test_df,\n    columns=columns_to_consider,\n    keep='first'\n)\n\n# Define numerical columns again after Task 1 and Task 2\nnumerical_cols = [\n    'Previous qualification (grade)', 'Admission grade',\n    'Curricular units 1st sem (credited)', 'Curricular units 1st sem (enrolled)',\n    'Curricular units 1st sem (evaluations)', 'Curricular units 1st sem (approved)',\n    'Curricular units 1st sem (grade)', 'Curricular units 1st sem (without evaluations)',\n    'Curricular units 2nd sem (credited)', 'Curricular units 2nd sem (enrolled)',\n    'Curricular units 2nd sem (evaluations)', 'Curricular units 2nd sem (approved)',\n    'Curricular units 2nd sem (grade)', 'Curricular units 2nd sem (without evaluations)',\n    'Unemployment rate', 'Inflation rate', 'GDP', 'Age at enrollment', 'Application order'\n]\n\n# Ensure numerical columns exist after previous tasks\nnumerical_cols = [col for col in numerical_cols if col in cleaned_train_df.columns]\n\n# Convert numerical columns to appropriate data types\ncleaned_train_df = convert_data_types(\n    data=cleaned_train_df,\n    columns=numerical_cols,\n    target_type='float'  # Assuming all are floats; adjust if some are integers\n)\n\ncleaned_test_df = convert_data_types(\n    data=cleaned_test_df,\n    columns=numerical_cols,\n    target_type='float'\n)\n\n# Convert 'id' column to string\ncleaned_train_df = convert_data_types(\n    data=cleaned_train_df,\n    columns=['id'],\n    target_type='str'\n)\n\ncleaned_test_df = convert_data_types(\n    data=cleaned_test_df,\n    columns=['id'],\n    target_type='str'\n)\n\n# Verify data types (optional)\n# print(cleaned_train_df.dtypes)\n# print(cleaned_test_df.dtypes)\n\n# Save the final cleaned datasets\ncleaned_train_df.to_csv(CLEANED_DATA_DIR + 'cleaned_train.csv', index=False)\ncleaned_test_df.to_csv(CLEANED_DATA_DIR + 'cleaned_test.csv', index=False)\n\nprint(\"Data Cleaning Phase Completed: 'cleaned_train.csv' and 'cleaned_test.csv' have been saved successfully.\")\n```\n\n### EXPLANATION:\n- **Removing Duplicates:**\n  - The `remove_duplicates` tool is utilized to drop duplicate rows based on all columns except the `id`. This ensures that each `id` remains unique while eliminating redundant data entries.\n  - The parameter `keep='first'` retains the first occurrence of each duplicate, ensuring that no unique data is unnecessarily discarded.\n  \n- **Data Type Conversion:**\n  - **Numerical Columns:** All numerical columns are converted to `float` type using the `convert_data_types` tool. If certain columns are strictly integers, adjust `target_type` accordingly for those specific columns.\n  - **ID Column:** The `id` column is converted to `str` to preserve its formatting, preventing issues like the removal of leading zeros which could alter the identifier's integrity.\n  \n- **Saving Cleaned Data:**\n  - The final cleaned datasets, `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`, are saved in the specified directory. This aligns with the Data Saving constraints provided.\n  \n- **Completion Message:** A print statement confirms the successful completion of the Data Cleaning phase and the saving of the cleaned datasets.\n\n---\n\n## FINAL OUTPUT:\nAfter executing all four tasks, the cleaned datasets `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv` are available in the specified directory:\n```\n/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/classification_with_an_academic_success_dataset/\n```\n\nThese datasets have:\n- Handled missing values appropriately.\n- Removed columns with excessive missing data.\n- Managed outliers in numerical features.\n- Standardized categorical features for consistency.\n- Removed duplicate rows and ensured correct data types.\n\nThis completes the Data Cleaning phase, setting a strong foundation for the subsequent phases of Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, and Model Building."

This threshold was chosen to minimize noise and potential biases introduced by features that contain inadequate information for analysis and modeling.\n\n### Question 3\n**What outlier handling methods were applied, and how did these methods affect the distribution of numerical features?**\n\n- Outliers were handled using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method with a factor of 1.5, where outlier values were clipped. This method capped extreme values at the upper and lower bounds, enhancing the robustness of the numerical features while preserving the overall distribution without dramatically compressing feature ranges.\n\n### Question 4\n**How were categorical features standardized, and what common issues (e.g., typos, case sensitivity) were corrected?**\n\n- Categorical features were standardized by:\n  - Converting all strings to lowercase.\n  - Stripping leading and trailing whitespaces.\n  - Placeholder for correcting common typos based on predefined mappings (not yet implemented).\n  \nThis approach helped eliminate discrepancies due to case sensitivity and unwanted spaces.\n\n### Question 5\n**What were the outcomes of the duplicate removal process, and how many duplicate rows were identified and eliminated?**\n\n- The duplicate removal step ensured that all rows, except the unique identifier (`id`), were checked for duplicates. The exact number of duplicates eliminated was not specified in the output, but this process ensures that each `id` remains unique.\n\n### Question 6\n**What insights or patterns emerged during the data cleaning phase that should be explored further in the In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis?**\n\n- While there were no visual insights provided from this phase, the handling of missing values and outliers may indicate areas of interest in the data distribution and relationships between features. It would be beneficial to explore how these cleaned features correlate with the target variable (academic risk classification) in the next exploratory analysis phase.\n\n---\n\nThis detailed summary encapsulates the important aspects of the Data Cleaning phase, setting the stage for the next steps in your analysis process."

Numerical features were ensured to be in appropriate types (float).\n\n### Question 3\nWhat specific missing values were addressed during the data cleaning process, and what imputation methods were used for both numerical and categorical features?\n### Answer 3\n- **Numerical Features:** Missing values were addressed using the median for the following features:\n  - Previous qualification (grade), Admission grade, Curricular units (credited/enrolled/evaluations/approved/grade for both semesters), Unemployment rate, Inflation rate, GDP.\n  \n- **Categorical Features:** Missing values were addressed using the mode for:\n  - Marital status, Application mode, Course, Previous qualification, Nationality, Mother's qualification, Father's qualification, Mother's occupation, Father's occupation, Displaced, Educational special needs, Debtor, Tuition fees up to date, Gender, Scholarship holder, International.\n\n### Question 4\nWhat outlier handling methods were applied, and how did these methods affect the distribution of numerical features?\n### Answer 4\n- Outliers were handled using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method with a factor of 1.5. Outliers were clipped at the upper and lower bounds, which enhanced the robustness of the numerical features while preserving the overall distribution without dramatically compressing feature ranges.\n\n### Question 5\nHow were categorical features standardized, and what common issues (e.g., typos, case sensitivity) were corrected?\n### Answer 5\n- Categorical features were standardized by:\n  - Converting all strings to lowercase.\n  - Stripping leading and trailing whitespaces.\n  - A placeholder for correcting common typos based on predefined mappings was noted but not yet implemented.\n\n### Question 6\nWhat were the outcomes of the duplicate removal process, and how many duplicate rows were identified and eliminated?\n### Answer 6\n- The duplicate removal process ensured all rows, except for the unique identifier (`id`), were checked for duplicates. The specific number of duplicates eliminated was not stated, but this step ensured that each `id` remained unique across the datasets.\n\n### Question 7\nWhat insights or patterns emerged during the data cleaning phase that should be explored further in the In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis?\n### Answer 7\n- While no visual insights were provided, the handling of missing values and outliers suggests areas of interest for further analysis. Exploring how the cleaned features correlate with the target variable (academic risk classification) may reveal significant insights in the next exploratory analysis phase."
