### Step 1: Analyze the Error

The error message indicates a `KeyError` related to the `'Target'` column:

```
KeyError: Index(['Target'], dtype='object')
```

This error arises in the `remove_duplicates` function when attempting to drop duplicates based on the specified `columns_to_consider`. Here's a breakdown of the issue:

1. **Columns Selection**:
   - `columns_to_consider` is defined based on `cleaned_train_df.columns` excluding `'id'`.
   - This list likely includes the `'Target'` column present in `cleaned_train_df`.

2. **Applying to `cleaned_test_df`**:
   - When the same `columns_to_consider` (which includes `'Target'`) is applied to `cleaned_test_df`, it raises a `KeyError` because `cleaned_test_df` does not contain the `'Target'` column.

### Step 2: Correct the Error

To resolve this issue, ensure that the `columns_to_consider` for each DataFrame only includes columns that exist within that specific DataFrame. This means defining separate `columns_to_consider` lists for `cleaned_train_df` and `cleaned_test_df`.

### Step 3: Corrected Code Snippet

```python
# Task 4: Remove Duplicate Rows and Convert Data Types

# Remove duplicates based on all columns except 'id' for the training dataset
columns_to_consider_train = [col for col in cleaned_train_df.columns if col != 'id']
cleaned_train_df = remove_duplicates(
    data=cleaned_train_df,
    columns=columns_to_consider_train,
    keep='first'
)

# Remove duplicates based on all columns except 'id' for the test dataset
columns_to_consider_test = [col for col in cleaned_test_df.columns if col != 'id']
cleaned_test_df = remove_duplicates(
    data=cleaned_test_df,
    columns=columns_to_consider_test,
    keep='first'
)
```

### Explanation of Corrections

1. **Separate Columns Selection**:
   - **Training DataFrame (`cleaned_train_df`)**:
     - `columns_to_consider_train` excludes `'id'` but includes all other columns present in `cleaned_train_df`, including `'Target'`.
   - **Test DataFrame (`cleaned_test_df`)**:
     - `columns_to_consider_test` excludes `'id'` and only includes columns that exist in `cleaned_test_df`, which does not include `'Target'`.
   
2. **Apply `remove_duplicates` Separately**:
   - By defining and using separate `columns_to_consider` lists for each DataFrame, we ensure that the `remove_duplicates` function only attempts to drop duplicates based on existing columns, preventing the `KeyError`.

3. **Maintain Consistency**:
   - This approach ensures that both training and test datasets are cleaned of duplicate rows based on their respective relevant columns without causing errors due to missing columns.

### Additional Recommendations

- **Validation**:
  - After performing these operations, it's good practice to validate that duplicates have been removed as expected.
  
- **Logging**:
  - Implement logging to monitor the number of duplicates removed from each DataFrame, which can aid in later analysis and debugging.

- **Modularity**:
  - Consider encapsulating the duplicate removal process into a function to avoid repetition and enhance code readability.
