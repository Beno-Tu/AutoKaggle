**Step 1: Analyze the Error**

The error message indicates that the code is running out of time due to resource constraints and suggests trying fewer models. This implies that training all three models (`"random forest"`, `"XGBoost"`, and `"logistic regression"`) is computationally intensive and exceeds the available resources or allotted time.

**Step 2: Determine How to Fix the Error**

To resolve the issue, we should reduce the number of models being trained. By selecting fewer models, we decrease the computational load and the time required for training, which should prevent the error related to running out of time. Additionally, choosing models that are less resource-intensive can help manage resource usage more effectively.

**Step 3: Corrected Code Snippet**

```python
# Define problem type and selected models
problem_type = "multiclass"
selected_models = ["random forest", "logistic regression"]  # Reduced number of models

print(f"Starting model training with models: {selected_models} for a {problem_type} problem.")

# Train models and select the best one
best_model = train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model(
    X=X_train_scaled,
    y=y_train,
    problem_type=problem_type,
    selected_models=selected_models
)
```
