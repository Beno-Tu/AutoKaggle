**Tools:** Pandas (`read_csv`, `pop`, `drop`)\n  - **Involved Features:** \n    - Remove `id` and `Target` columns.\n    - Ensure numerical features are retained.\n  - **Parameters:** \n    - File paths for `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`.\n- **Expected output or Impact on data:**\n  - `X_train` and `y_train` DataFrames separated.\n  - `X_test` DataFrame prepared without `id` and non-numeric columns.\n- **Constraints:**\n  - Maintain feature alignment between training and test sets.\n  - Prevent data leakage by excluding `Target` from test data.\n\n### STEP 2\nTask: **Feature Scaling and Transformation Verification**\n- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**\n  - **Tools:** Scikit-learn (`StandardScaler`), Pandas (`describe`)\n  - **Involved Features:** All numerical features in `X_train` and `X_test` (e.g., `Admission grade`, `GDP`, `Age at enrollment`)\n  - **Parameters:** \n    - Use `StandardScaler` for scaling numerical features.\n- **Expected output or Impact on data:**\n  - Scaled `X_train_scaled` and `X_test_scaled` ensuring uniform feature scales.\n  - Verified consistency in feature engineering between datasets.\n- **Constraints:**\n  - Apply scaling parameters derived from `X_train` to `X_test`.\n  -

Trained models with cross-validated accuracy scores.\n  - Selection of the best-performing model based on mean accuracy.\n- **Constraints:**\n  - Limit training to three selected models to adhere to computational resources.\n  - Ensure reproducibility by setting a consistent `random_state`.\n\n### STEP 4\nTask: **Prediction and Submission Preparation**\n- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**\n  - **Tools:** Scikit-learn (`predict` method), Pandas (`DataFrame`, `to_csv`)\n  - **Involved Features:** \n    - `id` from `test_df`\n    - Predicted `Target` labels from the best model.\n  - **Parameters:** \n    - Ensure `submission.csv` follows the format:\n      ```\n      id,Target\n      76518,Graduate\n      76519,Graduate\n      76520,Graduate\n      ```\n- **Expected output or Impact on data:**\n  -

The competition runs from June 1 to June 30, 2024, with specific deadlines for submissions.\n    </competition_info>\n</INPUT>\n<EXECUTION RESULT>\n## PLAN\n\n### STEP 1\nTask: **Data Preparation for Modeling**\n- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**\n  - **Tools:** Pandas (`read_csv`, `pop`, `drop`)\n  - **Involved Features:** \n    - Remove `id` and `Target` columns.\n    - Ensure numerical features are retained.\n  - **Parameters:** \n    - File paths for `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`.\n- **Expected output or Impact on data:**\n  - `X_train` and `y_train` DataFrames separated.\n  - `X_test` DataFrame prepared without `id` and non-numeric columns.\n- **Constraints:**\n  - Maintain feature alignment between training and test sets.\n  - Prevent data leakage by excluding `Target` from test data.\n\n### STEP 2\nTask: **Feature Scaling and Transformation Verification**\n- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**\n  - **Tools:** Scikit-learn (`StandardScaler`), Pandas (`describe`)\n  - **Involved Features:** All numerical features in `X_train` and `X_test` (e.g., `Admission grade`, `GDP`, `Age at enrollment`)\n  - **Parameters:** \n    - Use `StandardScaler` for scaling numerical features.\n- **Expected output or Impact on data:**\n  - Scaled `X_train_scaled` and `X_test_scaled` ensuring uniform feature scales.\n  - Verified consistency in feature engineering between datasets.\n- **Constraints:**\n  - Apply scaling parameters derived from `X_train` to `X_test`.\n  - Avoid introducing new features during verification.\n\n### STEP 3\nTask: **Model Training, Validation, and Selection**\n- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**\n  - **Tools:** `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model`\n  - **Involved Features:** \n    - All preprocessed numerical features in `X_train_scaled`.\n    - Target variable `y_train`.\n  - **Parameters:** \n    - `problem_type`: `\"multiclass\"`\n    - `selected_models`: `[\"Random Forest\", \"XGBoost\", \"Logistic Regression\"]`\n- **Expected output or Impact on data:**\n  - Trained models with cross-validated accuracy scores.\n  - Selection of the best-performing model based on mean accuracy.\n- **Constraints:**\n  - Limit training to three selected models to adhere to computational resources.\n  - Ensure reproducibility by setting a consistent `random_state`.\n\n### STEP 4\nTask: **Prediction and Submission Preparation**\n- **Tools, involved features and correct parameters:**\n  - **Tools:** Scikit-learn (`predict` method), Pandas (`DataFrame`, `to_csv`)\n  - **Involved Features:** \n    - `id` from `test_df`\n    - Predicted `Target` labels from the best model.\n  - **Parameters:** \n    - Ensure `submission.csv` follows the format:\n      ```\n      id,Target\n      76518,Graduate\n      76519,Graduate\n      76520,Graduate\n      ```\n- **Expected output or Impact on data:**\n  - `submission.csv` file ready for competition submission with accurate `Target` predictions.\n- **Constraints:**\n  - Ensure `id` values in submission match those in `processed_test.csv`.\n  - Validate that `Target` predictions are correctly formatted as categorical labels (`dropout`, `enrolled`, `graduate`).\n  - Confirm no missing values in the submission file.\n</EXECUTION RESULT>\n\n"
