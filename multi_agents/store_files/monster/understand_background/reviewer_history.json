Boo!\n\nCan you classify monsters haunting Kaggle?\n\n![](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/5708/images/header)\n\n[Overview](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo/overview)[Data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo/data)[Code](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo/code)[Models](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo/models)[Discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo/discussion)[Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo/leaderboard)[Rules](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo/rules)\n\n## Overview\n\nStart\n\nNov 1, 2016\n\n###### Close\n\nDec 2, 2016\n\n### Description\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nGet out your dowsing rods, electromagnetic sensors, \u2026 and gradient boosting machines. Kaggle is haunted and we need your help. After a month of making scientific observations and taking careful measurements, we\u2019ve determined that 900 ghouls, ghosts, and goblins are infesting our halls and frightening our data scientists. When\u00a0trying garlic, asking politely, and using reverse psychology didn't work, it became clear that machine learning is the only answer to banishing\u00a0our unwanted guests.\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/kaggle/5708/media/halloween-660x.png)\n\nSo now the hour has come to put the data we\u2019ve collected in your hands. We\u2019ve managed to identify 371 of the ghastly creatures, but need your help to vanquish the rest. And only an accurate classification algorithm can thwart them. Use bone length measurements, severity of rot, extent of soullessness, and other characteristics to distinguish (and extinguish) the intruders. Are you ghost-busters up for the challenge?\n\n### Evaluation\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on the categorization accuracy (the percent of creatures\u00a0that you correctly classify).\n\n## Submission File\n\nYour submission file should predict the type\u00a0for each creature\u00a0in the test set. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\nid,type  \n0,Ghost  \n1,Goblin  \n2,Ghoul  \netc.\n\n### Citation\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nWendy Kan. (2016).

Competition Overview\nThe \"Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!\" competition challenges participants to classify 900 creatures into three categories: Ghoul, Goblin, and Ghost, using machine learning techniques based on various features.\n\n## 2. Files\n- **train.csv**: The training dataset containing features and the target variable (`type`).\n- **test.csv**: The test dataset containing only features, without the target variable.\n- **sample_submission.csv**: A template for the correct submission format.\n\n## 3. Problem Definition\nThe objective is to develop a classification model that accurately predicts the type of creature based on provided features, evaluated by the accuracy of classification.\n\n## 4. Data Information\n### 4.1 Data type\n#### 4.1.1 ID type\n- `id`: Unique identifier for each data point (not used in training).\n\n#### 4.1.2 Numerical type\n- `bone_length`: Average length of bone (normalized between 0 and 1).\n- `rotting_flesh`: Percentage of rotting flesh.\n- `hair_length`: Average hair length (normalized between 0 and 1).\n- `has_soul`: Percentage of soul in the creature.\n\n#### 4.1.3 Categorical type\n- `color`: Dominant color (options: 'white', 'black', 'clear', 'blue', 'green', 'blood').\n- `type`: The target variable (only in training data; options: 'Ghost', 'Goblin', 'Ghoul').\n\n#### 4.1.4 Datetime type\n- None.\n\n### 4.2 Detailed data description\n- **Training Data**: 20 entries with numerical and categorical features, including measurements and the target variable.\n- **Testing Data**: 10 entries with the same features as the training data but without the target variable.\n\n## 5. Target Variable\n- **Target Variable**: `type`\n- **Description**: Classifies the creature into one of three categories: 'Ghoul', 'Goblin', 'Ghost'.\n\n## 6. Evaluation Metrics\nSubmissions are evaluated based on categorization accuracy, specifically the percentage of correctly classified creatures.\n\n## 7. Submission Format\nThe submission file must include:\n- **Columns**:\n  - `id`: Unique identifier (int).\n  - `type`: Predicted class of the entity (categorical).\n\n## 8. Other Key Aspects\n- Explore relationships between numerical features and the target variable.\n- Investigate interactions between categorical variables and numerical features.\n- Consider normalization and feature scaling to enhance model performance.\n- Look into potential feature engineering opportunities to improve predictive accuracy.\n```\n</EXECUTION RESULT>\n\n"
