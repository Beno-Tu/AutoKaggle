### TASK 1: Create Interaction and Derived Features

**THOUGHT PROCESS:**

To enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns in the data, we'll create new interaction and derived features from the existing numerical columns. Specifically, we'll:

1. **Interaction Terms:**
   - `hair_length_has_soul` = `hair_length` × `has_soul`
   - `bone_length_rotting_flesh` = `bone_length` × `rotting_flesh`

2. **Polynomial Features:**
   - `bone_length_squared` = (`bone_length`)²
   - `rotting_flesh_squared` = (`rotting_flesh`)²

3. **Ratio Features:**
   - `bone_to_flesh_ratio` = `bone_length` / `rotting_flesh`
   - `soul_to_hair_ratio` = `has_soul` / `hair_length`

We'll ensure that these derived features do not introduce multicollinearity by checking the correlation matrix after creation. Additionally, we'll handle any potential division by zero issues by adding a small epsilon where necessary.

**CODE:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import os
import numpy as np

# Define file paths
data_dir = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/ghouls_goblins_and_ghosts_boo/'
cleaned_train_file = os.path.join(data_dir, 'cleaned_train.csv')
cleaned_test_file = os.path.join(data_dir, 'cleaned_test.csv')

# Load the cleaned datasets
try:
    train_df = pd.read_csv(cleaned_train_file)
    test_df = pd.read_csv(cleaned_test_file)
    print("Cleaned datasets loaded successfully.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading cleaned datasets: {e}")
    raise

# Create copies to avoid modifying original data
train_fe = train_df.copy()
test_fe = test_df.copy()

# Define numerical columns
numerical_cols = ['bone_length', 'rotting_flesh', 'hair_length', 'has_soul']

# Function to create derived features
def create_derived_features(df):
    df['hair_length_has_soul'] = df['hair_length'] * df['has_soul']
    df['bone_length_rotting_flesh'] = df['bone_length'] * df['rotting_flesh']
    df['bone_length_squared'] = df['bone_length'] ** 2
    df['rotting_flesh_squared'] = df['rotting_flesh'] ** 2
    # Add a small epsilon to denominator to prevent division by zero
    epsilon = 1e-5
    df['bone_to_flesh_ratio'] = df['bone_length'] / (df['rotting_flesh'] + epsilon)
    df['soul_to_hair_ratio'] = df['has_soul'] / (df['hair_length'] + epsilon)
    return df

# Apply feature creation to training and testing data
train_fe = create_derived_features(train_fe)
test_fe = create_derived_features(test_fe)

# Check for infinite or NaN values and handle them
train_fe.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan, inplace=True)
test_fe.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan, inplace=True)

# Optionally, fill NaN values with median or any other strategy
train_fe.fillna(train_fe.median(), inplace=True)
test_fe.fillna(test_fe.median(), inplace=True)

# Prevent multicollinearity by removing features with high correlation
# Calculate correlation matrix
corr_matrix = train_fe[numerical_cols + [
    'hair_length_has_soul', 'bone_length_rotting_flesh',
    'bone_length_squared', 'rotting_flesh_squared',
    'bone_to_flesh_ratio', 'soul_to_hair_ratio'
]].corr().abs()

# Select upper triangle of correlation matrix
upper = corr_matrix.where(np.triu(np.ones(corr_matrix.shape), k=1).astype(bool))

# Find features with correlation greater than 0.9
to_drop = [column for column in upper.columns if any(upper[column] > 0.9)]

# Drop highly correlated features
train_fe.drop(columns=to_drop, inplace=True)
test_fe.drop(columns=to_drop, inplace=True)

print("Derived features created and multicollinearity addressed.")

# Update the list of numerical columns to include new features
new_numerical_cols = [
    'hair_length_has_soul', 'bone_length_rotting_flesh',
    'bone_length_squared', 'rotting_flesh_squared',
    'bone_to_flesh_ratio', 'soul_to_hair_ratio'
]
numerical_cols.extend(new_numerical_cols)
```

**EXPLANATION:**

1. **Data Loading and Copying:**
   - Loaded the `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv` datasets.
   - Created copies (`train_fe` and `test_fe`) to ensure the original data remains unaltered.

2. **Derived Feature Creation:**
   - Defined a function `create_derived_features` to generate interaction terms, polynomial features, and ratio features.
   - Applied this function to both training and testing datasets.

3. **Handling Infinite and Missing Values:**
   - Replaced any infinite values resulting from division by zero with `NaN`.
   - Filled `NaN` values with the median of each column to maintain data integrity.

4. **Multicollinearity Prevention:**
   - Computed the correlation matrix for all numerical features, including the newly created ones.
   - Identified and removed features that had a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 with any other feature to prevent multicollinearity.

5. **Updating Numerical Columns List:**
   - Added the newly created numerical features to the `numerical_cols` list for future processing steps.

### TASK 2: Encode Categorical Variables

**THOUGHT PROCESS:**

The categorical feature `color` needs to be transformed into a numerical format for model ingestion. Given the limited number of categories and no ordinal relationship, **One-Hot Encoding** is appropriate. This will create binary columns for each unique color category. Additionally, we'll ensure that both training and testing datasets have the same set of encoded columns by aligning them after encoding. If any unseen categories appear in the test set, they will be handled by adding an `unknown` category during encoding.

**CODE:**

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Define the categorical column
categorical_cols = ['color']

# Initialize OneHotEncoder
ohe = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', sparse=False)

# Fit the encoder on training data
ohe.fit(train_fe[categorical_cols])

# Transform training data
train_ohe = pd.DataFrame(
    ohe.transform(train_fe[categorical_cols]),
    columns=ohe.get_feature_names_out(categorical_cols),
    index=train_fe.index
)

# Transform testing data
test_ohe = pd.DataFrame(
    ohe.transform(test_fe[categorical_cols]),
    columns=ohe.get_feature_names_out(categorical_cols),
    index=test_fe.index
)

# Drop original categorical columns from datasets
train_fe.drop(columns=categorical_cols, inplace=True)
test_fe.drop(columns=categorical_cols, inplace=True)

# Concatenate the One-Hot Encoded columns
train_fe = pd.concat([train_fe, train_ohe], axis=1)
test_fe = pd.concat([test_fe, test_ohe], axis=1)

print("Categorical variable 'color' encoded using One-Hot Encoding.")
```

**EXPLANATION:**

1. **One-Hot Encoding Initialization:**
   - Utilized `OneHotEncoder` from Scikit-learn with `handle_unknown='ignore'` to gracefully handle any unseen categories in the test set by ignoring them during transformation.

2. **Fitting and Transformation:**
   - Fitted the encoder on the training data's `color` column.
   - Transformed both training and testing datasets using the fitted encoder to ensure consistency in encoding.

3. **Data Integration:**
   - Dropped the original `color` column from both datasets.
   - Concatenated the newly created One-Hot Encoded columns (`train_ohe` and `test_ohe`) to the respective datasets.

This ensures that the categorical data is now in a suitable numerical format for model training and prediction.

### TASK 3: Normalize and Scale Numerical Features

**THOUGHT PROCESS:**

Scaling numerical features is essential to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model's performance, especially for algorithms sensitive to feature scales (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression). We'll use **StandardScaler** to standardize features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This scaler is suitable for most machine learning algorithms. We'll fit the scaler on the training data and transform both training and testing datasets using the same parameters to prevent data leakage.

**CODE:**

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Define the numerical features to scale
features_to_scale = numerical_cols.copy()

# Initialize StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Fit the scaler on training data
scaler.fit(train_fe[features_to_scale])

# Transform training data
train_fe_scaled = scaler.transform(train_fe[features_to_scale])
train_fe_scaled = pd.DataFrame(train_fe_scaled, columns=features_to_scale, index=train_fe.index)

# Transform testing data
test_fe_scaled = scaler.transform(test_fe[features_to_scale])
test_fe_scaled = pd.DataFrame(test_fe_scaled, columns=features_to_scale, index=test_fe.index)

# Replace original features with scaled features
train_fe[features_to_scale] = train_fe_scaled
test_fe[features_to_scale] = test_fe_scaled

print("Numerical features normalized using StandardScaler.")
```

**EXPLANATION:**

1. **Scaler Initialization:**
   - Selected `StandardScaler` for standardizing the numerical features.

2. **Fitting and Transformation:**
   - Fitted the scaler on the training dataset's numerical features to compute the mean and standard deviation.
   - Transformed both training and testing datasets using the fitted scaler to ensure that both datasets are scaled consistently.

3. **Data Integration:**
   - Replaced the original numerical features in both datasets with their scaled counterparts.

This standardization ensures that all numerical features are on the same scale, which can improve the efficiency and performance of many machine learning algorithms.

### TASK 4: Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction

**THOUGHT PROCESS:**

To enhance model performance and reduce computational complexity, we'll perform feature selection to identify and retain the most relevant features. We'll use a **Random Forest Classifier** to compute feature importance scores and select the top features based on these scores. Additionally, we'll remove any redundant features identified in previous steps. This approach ensures that the model focuses on the most predictive features, potentially improving accuracy and reducing overfitting.

**CODE:**

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Separate features and target in training data
X_train = train_fe.drop(columns=['type', 'id'])
y_train = train_fe['type']

# Initialize Random Forest Classifier
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Fit the model
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get feature importances
importances = rf.feature_importances_
feature_names = X_train.columns
feature_importances = pd.Series(importances, index=feature_names).sort_values(ascending=False)

print("Feature importances from Random Forest:")
print(feature_importances)

# Select top 10 features based on importance
top_features = feature_importances.head(10).index.tolist()

# Filter the datasets to retain only the top features
train_fe_selected = train_fe[['id'] + top_features + ['type']]
test_fe_selected = test_fe[['id'] + top_features]

print(f"Selected top {len(top_features)} features for modeling.")

# Update the features_to_scale list to include only selected features
features_to_scale = top_features.copy()
```

**EXPLANATION:**

1. **Model Training for Feature Importance:**
   - Separated the features (`X_train`) and the target variable (`y_train`) from the training dataset.
   - Trained a `RandomForestClassifier` to compute the importance of each feature.

2. **Feature Importance Extraction:**
   - Extracted and sorted the feature importances from the trained model.
   - Printed the feature importance scores for review.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Selected the top 10 most important features based on the importance scores.
   - Filtered both training and testing datasets to retain only these top features along with the `id` and `type` columns.

4. **Updating Features List:**
   - Updated the `features_to_scale` list to include only the selected top features, ensuring consistency in future processing steps.

This feature selection process ensures that the model focuses on the most impactful features, potentially improving performance and reducing overfitting.

### Saving the Processed Datasets

**THOUGHT PROCESS:**

After completing all feature engineering tasks, we'll save the processed training and testing datasets to the specified directories with clear and meaningful filenames as per the constraints.

**CODE:**

```python
# Define processed file paths
processed_train_file = os.path.join(data_dir, 'processed_train.csv')
processed_test_file = os.path.join(data_dir, 'processed_test.csv')

# Save the processed datasets
try:
    train_fe_selected.to_csv(processed_train_file, index=False)
    test_fe_selected.to_csv(processed_test_file, index=False)
    print("Processed datasets saved successfully as 'processed_train.csv' and 'processed_test.csv'.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error saving processed datasets: {e}")
    raise
```

**EXPLANATION:**

1. **File Path Definition:**
   - Defined the paths for the processed training and testing datasets as `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv` respectively.

2. **Saving the Datasets:**
   - Saved the `train_fe_selected` and `test_fe_selected` DataFrames to their corresponding CSV files.
   - Incorporated error handling to catch and report any issues during the saving process.

This ensures that the feature-engineered datasets are stored appropriately for subsequent phases like model building and validation.
