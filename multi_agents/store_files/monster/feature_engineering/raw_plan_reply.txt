## **Feature Engineering Plan**

### **Task 1: Create Interaction and Derived Features**

**Objective:**
Enhance the dataset by introducing new features that capture the interactions and relationships between existing numerical features, thereby providing the model with more nuanced information for classification.

**Essential Actions:**

1. **Interaction Terms:**
   - **Combine Numerical Features:**
     - **`hair_length` × `has_soul`:** Create a new feature that multiplies `hair_length` and `has_soul` to capture any synergistic effect between these attributes.
     - **`bone_length` × `rotting_flesh`:** Multiply `bone_length` with `rotting_flesh` to explore if the combination influences the creature type.

2. **Polynomial Features:**
   - **Square Terms:**
     - **`bone_length_squared`:** Square the `bone_length` to capture non-linear relationships.
     - **`rotting_flesh_squared`:** Square the `rotting_flesh` for similar reasons.
   - **Interaction Polynomial:**
     - **`hair_length_rotting_flesh`:** Multiply `hair_length` with `rotting_flesh` to create a composite feature.

3. **Ratio Features:**
   - **`bone_to_flesh_ratio`:** Divide `bone_length` by `rotting_flesh` to understand the proportional relationship.
   - **`soul_to_hair_ratio`:** Divide `has_soul` by `hair_length` to capture balance between these features.

**Tools and Methods:**
- **Pandas**: Utilize DataFrame operations to create new columns based on arithmetic operations of existing features.
- **Constraints:**
  - Ensure that the creation of interaction terms does not lead to multicollinearity issues.
  - Verify that derived features do not introduce missing or infinite values.

**Expected Output:**
- Addition of new features: `hair_length_has_soul`, `bone_length_rotting_flesh`, `bone_length_squared`, `rotting_flesh_squared`, `hair_length_rotting_flesh`, `bone_to_flesh_ratio`, `soul_to_hair_ratio`.

### **Task 2: Encode Categorical Variables**

**Objective:**
Transform the categorical feature `color` into a numerical format that can be effectively utilized by machine learning algorithms, capturing the inherent relationships between color and creature type.

**Essential Actions:**

1. **One-Hot Encoding:**
   - **Create Binary Indicators:** Convert the `color` feature into multiple binary columns representing each unique color (e.g., `color_clear`, `color_green`, `color_black`, `color_white`, `color_blue`).
   - **Handling Unseen Categories:** Ensure that any new categories in the test set are handled appropriately to maintain consistency.

2. **Target Encoding (Optional):**
   - **Calculate Mean Target Value:** Replace each category in `color` with the mean of the target variable `type`.
   - **Prevent Overfitting:** Use techniques such as smoothing or cross-validation to ensure that target encoding does not lead to data leakage.

**Tools and Methods:**
- **Pandas**: Utilize `get_dummies` for one-hot encoding.
- **Scikit-learn**: Use `TargetEncoder` from the `category_encoders` library if opting for target encoding.
- **Constraints:**
  - Decide between one-hot encoding and target encoding based on the data distribution and model requirements.
  - Avoid creating too many dummy variables if the number of categories is large, to prevent dimensionality issues.

**Expected Output:**
- Transformed `color` feature into numerical format, resulting in either multiple binary columns or a single encoded numerical column.

### **Task 3: Normalize and Scale Numerical Features**

**Objective:**
Ensure that all numerical features are on a comparable scale to improve the efficiency and performance of machine learning algorithms, especially those sensitive to feature scaling.

**Essential Actions:**

1. **Identify Features for Scaling:**
   - Numerical features to be scaled include: `bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`, and all newly created interaction and derived features.

2. **Scaling Techniques:**
   - **Min-Max Scaling:**
     - Scale features to a range between 0 and 1.
     - Suitable for algorithms like Neural Networks.
   - **Standardization (Z-score Scaling):**
     - Transform features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
     - Suitable for algorithms like Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression.

3. **Apply Scaling:**
   - Choose the appropriate scaling method based on the distribution and requirements of the chosen models.
   - Fit the scaler on the training data and transform both training and test datasets to prevent data leakage.

**Tools and Methods:**
- **Scikit-learn**: Utilize `MinMaxScaler` and `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.
- **Constraints:**
  - Apply scaling **after** splitting the data to avoid information leakage.
  - Maintain the same scaling parameters (mean and variance) when transforming the test set.

**Expected Output:**
- All numerical features are scaled appropriately, resulting in a dataset where features contribute equally to model training.

### **Task 4: Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction**

**Objective:**
Identify and retain the most relevant features that contribute significantly to predicting the target variable, thereby enhancing model performance and reducing computational complexity.

**Essential Actions:**

1. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - **Assess Correlations:**
     - Compute Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients between numerical features and the target variable.
     - Identify features with strong positive or negative correlations.
   - **Remove Redundant Features:**
     - Detect and eliminate features that are highly correlated with each other to prevent multicollinearity.

2. **Feature Importance from Models:**
   - **Tree-Based Models:**
     - Use algorithms like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to derive feature importance scores.
     - Select top features based on importance rankings.
   - **Regularization Techniques:**
     - Apply Lasso (L1) regularization to identify and retain significant features while shrinking less important ones.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction (Optional):**
   - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
     - Reduce the feature space by transforming features into principal components.
     - Retain components that explain a significant portion of the variance.
   - **Constraints:**
     - Ensure that dimensionality reduction does not obscure interpretability if model explainability is a priority.

4. **Finalize Feature Set:**
   - Combine insights from correlation analysis and model-based feature importance to finalize the set of features to be used in modeling.
   - Document the rationale for including or excluding each feature.

**Tools and Methods:**
- **Pandas**: For initial correlation computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Utilize `RandomForestClassifier`, `GradientBoostingClassifier`, and `PCA` for feature importance and dimensionality reduction.
- **Constraints:**
  - Avoid discarding features solely based on correlation without considering their interaction effects.
  - Ensure that feature selection methods are consistent across training and test datasets.

**Expected Output:**
- A refined set of features (`processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`) that includes only the most relevant and non-redundant variables, optimized for model training and prediction.

## **Summary of Outputs**

- **Processed Datasets:**
  - `processed_train.csv`: Training dataset enriched with interaction and derived features, encoded categorical variables, scaled numerical features, and selected relevant features.
  - `processed_test.csv`: Test dataset transformed consistently with the training set, ensuring compatibility for model predictions.
