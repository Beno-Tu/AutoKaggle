In the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis phase, it's important to visualize and understand the relationships within the data. A correlation matrix heatmap is particularly useful as it helps identify correlations between different features, which can inform decisions in the next phases, such as feature engineering and model building.

Given that there is only one image available, I will select that one.
