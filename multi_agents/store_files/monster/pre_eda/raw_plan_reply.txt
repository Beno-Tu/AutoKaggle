**Essential Actions:**
1. **Load Datasets:**
   - Import `train.csv` and `test.csv` using Pandas.
2. **Inspect Data Dimensions:**
   - Determine the number of rows and columns in each dataset.
3. **Verify Data Types:**
   - Check the data types of each feature to ensure they align with the provided information (e.g., numerical vs. categorical).
4. **Examine Unique Values:**
   - For categorical features, identify the number of unique categories to assess cardinality.

**Features Involved:**
- **Training Data:** `id`, `bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`, `color`, `type`
- **Testing Data:** `id`, `bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`, `color`

**Tools and Parameters:**
- **Pandas Functions:**
  - `pd.read_csv()`: Load datasets.
  - `.shape`: Get dimensions.
  - `.dtypes`: Inspect data types.
  - `.nunique()`: Count unique values.

**Expected Output:**
- **Text Summary:**
  - Number of rows and columns in both datasets.
  - Data types of each feature.
  - Number of unique values for categorical features (`color`, `type`).
  
**Constraints:**
- Ensure that both datasets are loaded without errors.
- Verify that the `test.csv` does not contain the `type` column.

### **Task 2: Descriptive Statistical Analysis**

**Objective:**  
Obtain basic statistical insights into numerical features and frequency distributions of categorical features to identify general patterns and potential areas of interest.

**Essential Actions:**
1. **Numerical Features Analysis:**
   - Compute summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for `bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, and `has_soul`.
2. **Categorical Features Analysis:**
   - Calculate frequency counts and proportions for the `color` feature.
3. **Target Variable Distribution:**
   - Analyze the distribution of the `type` classes in the training data to assess class balance.

**Features Involved:**
- **Numerical:** `bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`
- **Categorical:** `color`
- **Target Variable:** `type` (training data only)

**Tools and Parameters:**
- **Pandas Functions:**
  - `.describe()`: Generate descriptive statistics for numerical features.
  - `.value_counts()`: Obtain frequency counts for categorical features.
- **Visualization (if necessary):**
  - Text descriptions prioritize; generate basic plots only if text is insufficient.

**Expected Output:**
- **Text Descriptions:**
  - Summary tables for numerical features with key statistics.
  - Frequency tables for the `color` and `type` features.
  - Insights on class distribution (e.g., class imbalance if present).

**Constraints:**
- Focus on presenting statistical information in text format.
- Avoid generating visualizations unless critical patterns cannot be conveyed through text.

### **Task 3: Missing Values and Data Quality Assessment**

**Objective:**  
Identify and quantify missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies within the datasets to inform the subsequent Data Cleaning phase.

**Essential Actions:**
1. **Missing Values Identification:**
   - Check for missing or null values in each feature of both training and testing datasets.
2. **Outliers Detection:**
   - Assess numerical features for potential outliers using statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR).
3. **Categorical Consistency Check:**
   - Ensure that categorical features (`color`, `type`) have consistent and expected categories across datasets.
4. **Duplicate Entries Check:**
   - Identify any duplicate rows based on the `id` feature to ensure data uniqueness.

**Features Involved:**
- **All Features:** `id`, `bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`, `color`, `type` (training only)

**Tools and Parameters:**
- **Pandas Functions:**
  - `.isnull().sum()`: Count missing values per feature.
  - `.unique()`: List unique values in categorical features.
  - `.duplicated()`: Detect duplicate rows.
- **Statistical Methods:**
  - Compute Z-scores or IQR for numerical features to identify outliers.

**Expected Output:**
- **Text Summary:**
  - Number and percentage of missing values per feature.
  - List of numerical features with identified outliers and their counts.
  - Confirmation of categorical feature consistency (e.g., all expected color categories are present).
  - Number of duplicate entries, if any.

**Constraints:**
- Maintain a focus on text-based reporting for clarity.
- Limit outlier detection methods to basic statistical approaches to ensure efficiency.

### **Task 4: Feature Distributions and Correlation Analysis**

**Objective:**  
Understand the distribution patterns of individual features and explore relationships between numerical features to uncover potential predictive relationships.

**Essential Actions:**
1. **Univariate Distribution Analysis:**
   - Describe the distribution shape (e.g., skewness, modality) of each numerical feature.
2. **Bivariate Correlation Analysis:**
   - Calculate correlation coefficients between numerical features to identify strong associations.
   - Explore potential correlations between `has_soul` and other numerical features like `rotting_flesh` and `bone_length`.
3. **Categorical vs. Numerical Analysis:**
   - Assess the relationship between the `color` feature and numerical features to identify any notable patterns.

**Features Involved:**
- **Numerical:** `bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`
- **Categorical:** `color`
- **Target Variable:** `type` (for potential future analyses)

**Tools and Parameters:**
- **Pandas Functions:**
  - `.describe()`: For univariate statistics.
  - `.corr()`: Compute correlation matrix for numerical features.

  - Generate correlation heatmaps or box plots only if textual descriptions are insufficient.
  - Limit visualizations to the most critical correlations.

**Expected Output:**
- **Text Descriptions:**
  - Detailed descriptions of each numerical feature's distribution characteristics.
  - Summary of correlation coefficients, highlighting strong positive or negative relationships.
  - Insights into how categorical features like `color` may relate to numerical features.
