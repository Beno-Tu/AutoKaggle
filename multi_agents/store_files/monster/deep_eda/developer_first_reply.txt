### TASK 1: Detailed Univariate Analysis of Numerical Features

**THOUGHT PROCESS:**

For the univariate analysis of numerical features (`bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`), we'll perform the following:

1. **Descriptive Statistics:** Compute key statistical metrics to understand the distribution and central tendencies of each feature.
2. **Visualizations:** Create histograms with density plots, box plots, and violin plots to visualize the distribution and identify potential outliers.
3. **Saving Visuals:** Ensure that each visualization is saved with a clear and meaningful name in the specified images directory.

---

**CODE:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import os
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define file paths
data_dir = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/ghouls_goblins_and_ghosts_boo/'
images_dir = os.path.join(data_dir, 'deep_eda', 'images')
cleaned_train_file = os.path.join(data_dir, 'cleaned_train.csv')
cleaned_test_file = os.path.join(data_dir, 'cleaned_test.csv')

# Load the cleaned datasets
train_df = pd.read_csv(cleaned_train_file)
test_df = pd.read_csv(cleaned_test_file)

# Combine train and test for unified analysis if necessary
combined_df = pd.concat([train_df, test_df], axis=0, ignore_index=True)

# Define numerical features
numerical_features = ['bone_length', 'rotting_flesh', 'hair_length', 'has_soul']

# Create descriptive statistics
print("Descriptive Statistics for Numerical Features:\n")
desc_stats = train_df[numerical_features].describe().T
desc_stats['median'] = train_df[numerical_features].median()
desc_stats['mode'] = train_df[numerical_features].mode().iloc[0]
desc_stats['variance'] = train_df[numerical_features].var()
desc_stats['skewness'] = train_df[numerical_features].skew()
desc_stats['kurtosis'] = train_df[numerical_features].kurtosis()
print(desc_stats[['mean', 'median', 'mode', 'std', 'variance', 'skewness', 'kurtosis', 'min', '25%', '50%', '75%', 'max']])

# Visualization: Histograms with Density Plots
for feature in numerical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    sns.histplot(train_df[feature], kde=True, bins=30, color='skyblue')
    plt.title(f'Distribution of {feature}')
    plt.xlabel(feature)
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    histogram_path = os.path.join(images_dir, f'{feature}_distribution.png')
    plt.savefig(histogram_path)
    plt.close()
    print(f"Histogram for '{feature}' saved to '{histogram_path}'.")

# Visualization: Box Plots
for feature in numerical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 8))
    sns.boxplot(y=train_df[feature], color='lightgreen')
    plt.title(f'Box Plot of {feature}')
    plt.ylabel(feature)
    boxplot_path = os.path.join(images_dir, f'{feature}_boxplot.png')
    plt.savefig(boxplot_path)
    plt.close()
    print(f"Box plot for '{feature}' saved to '{boxplot_path}'.")

# Visualization: Violin Plots
for feature in numerical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 8))
    sns.violinplot(y=train_df[feature], color='lightcoral')
    plt.title(f'Violin Plot of {feature}')
    plt.ylabel(feature)
    violinplot_path = os.path.join(images_dir, f'{feature}_violinplot.png')
    plt.savefig(violinplot_path)
    plt.close()
    print(f"Violin plot for '{feature}' saved to '{violinplot_path}'.")
```

**EXPLANATION:**

- **Descriptive Statistics:** We compute and display a comprehensive set of statistical metrics for each numerical feature using Pandas' `describe()`, supplemented with median, mode, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.
  
- **Histograms with Density Plots:** Utilizing Seaborn's `histplot`, we visualize the distribution of each numerical feature, overlaying a density plot to assess the distribution shape.

- **Box Plots:** Seaborn's `boxplot` helps identify the presence of outliers and the spread of the data.

- **Violin Plots:** These plots combine aspects of box plots and density plots, providing a detailed view of the data distribution.

- **Saving Visuals:** Each plot is saved in the designated images directory with a descriptive filename, followed by `plt.close()` to free up resources.

### TASK 2: Comprehensive Categorical Feature Analysis

**THOUGHT PROCESS:**

For the categorical features (`color` and `type`), we'll:

1. **Frequency Distribution:** Calculate the count and percentage distribution of each category in the `color` feature.
2. **Association with Target Variable:** Explore the relationship between `color` and `type` by creating contingency tables and visualizing them using grouped bar charts.
3. **Saving Visuals:** Ensure that each visualization is saved appropriately with meaningful filenames.

---

**CODE:**

```python
# Define categorical features
categorical_features = ['color']
target_variable = 'type'

# Frequency Distribution for 'color'
color_counts = train_df['color'].value_counts()
color_percentages = train_df['color'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100
color_distribution = pd.DataFrame({'Count': color_counts, 'Percentage': color_percentages.round(2)})
print("\nFrequency Distribution of 'color':\n")
print(color_distribution)

# Visualization: Bar Chart for 'color' Distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x=color_counts.index, y=color_counts.values, palette='muted')
plt.title('Frequency of Each Color Category')
plt.xlabel('Color')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
color_bar_path = os.path.join(images_dir, 'color_frequency_bar.png')
plt.savefig(color_bar_path)
plt.close()
print(f"Bar chart for 'color' distribution saved to '{color_bar_path}'.")

# Association between 'color' and 'type'
color_type_ct = pd.crosstab(train_df['color'], train_df['type'])
print("\nContingency Table between 'color' and 'type':\n")
print(color_type_ct)

# Visualization: Grouped Bar Chart for 'color' vs 'type'
color_type_ct.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(10, 6), color=['#1f77b4', '#ff7f0e', '#2ca02c'])
plt.title('Color Distribution Across Creature Types')
plt.xlabel('Color')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.legend(title='Type')
color_type_bar_path = os.path.join(images_dir, 'color_type_grouped_bar.png')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig(color_type_bar_path)
plt.close()
print(f"Grouped bar chart for 'color' vs 'type' saved to '{color_type_bar_path}'.")
```

**EXPLANATION:**

- **Frequency Distribution:** We calculate and display the count and percentage of each category within the `color` feature to understand its distribution.

- **Bar Chart for 'color' Distribution:** A straightforward bar chart visualizes the frequency of each color category, aiding in quick interpretation.

- **Contingency Table:** Using Pandas' `crosstab`, we create a table showing the distribution of creature types across different colors.

- **Grouped Bar Chart for 'color' vs 'type':** This visualization helps identify patterns or associations between the `color` and the target variable `type`, highlighting any distinct trends or imbalances.

### TASK 3: Multivariate Analysis to Uncover Feature Interactions

**THOUGHT PROCESS:**

To explore interactions between numerical features and their relationship with the target variable, we'll:

1. **Correlation Analysis:** Compute both Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients to assess linear and monotonic relationships among numerical features.
2. **Heatmap Visualization:** Create a heatmap of the correlation matrix to visualize the strength and direction of relationships.
3. **Scatter Plots:** Generate scatter plots for selected pairs of numerical features, colored by the `type` to observe potential separations or clusters.
4. **Saving Visuals:** Ensure all plots are saved with clear filenames.

---

**CODE:**

```python
# Correlation Analysis
pearson_corr = train_df[numerical_features].corr(method='pearson')
spearman_corr = train_df[numerical_features].corr(method='spearman')

print("\nPearson Correlation Matrix:\n")
print(pearson_corr)

print("\nSpearman Correlation Matrix:\n")
print(spearman_corr)

# Visualization: Heatmap of Pearson Correlation
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(pearson_corr, annot=True, fmt=".2f", cmap='coolwarm', annot_kws={"size": 10}, linewidths=.5)
plt.title('Pearson Correlation Heatmap')
heatmap_path = os.path.join(images_dir, 'pearson_correlation_heatmap.png')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig(heatmap_path)
plt.close()
print(f"Pearson correlation heatmap saved to '{heatmap_path}'.")

# Visualization: Heatmap of Spearman Correlation
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(spearman_corr, annot=True, fmt=".2f", cmap='coolwarm', annot_kws={"size": 10}, linewidths=.5)
plt.title('Spearman Correlation Heatmap')
spearman_heatmap_path = os.path.join(images_dir, 'spearman_correlation_heatmap.png')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig(spearman_heatmap_path)
plt.close()
print(f"Spearman correlation heatmap saved to '{spearman_heatmap_path}'.")

# Scatter Plots for Selected Feature Pairs
selected_pairs = [('bone_length', 'rotting_flesh'), ('hair_length', 'has_soul')]

for x, y in selected_pairs:
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    sns.scatterplot(data=train_df, x=x, y=y, hue='type', palette='deep')
    plt.title(f'Scatter Plot of {x} vs {y} by Type')
    plt.xlabel(x)
    plt.ylabel(y)
    plt.legend(title='Type')
    scatter_path = os.path.join(images_dir, f'scatter_{x}_vs_{y}.png')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig(scatter_path)
    plt.close()
    print(f"Scatter plot for '{x}' vs '{y}' saved to '{scatter_path}'.")
```

**EXPLANATION:**

- **Correlation Analysis:** We compute both Pearson (linear relationships) and Spearman (monotonic relationships) correlation matrices to understand how numerical features relate to each other.

- **Heatmap Visualization:** Heatmaps of the correlation matrices provide a visual representation of the strength and direction of correlations, making it easier to identify highly correlated feature pairs.

- **Scatter Plots:** By plotting selected feature pairs and coloring the points based on the `type`, we can visually assess whether certain features help in distinguishing between different creature types.

- **Saving Visuals:** Each correlation heatmap and scatter plot is saved with a descriptive filename, ensuring clarity and adherence to the specified directory structure.

### TASK 4: Visualization of Key Insights and Pattern Summaries

**THOUGHT PROCESS:**

To synthesize the key insights from the analysis, we'll:

1. **Feature Distribution Across Target Classes:** Create box plots and violin plots for each numerical feature segmented by `type` to observe differences and overlaps.
2. **Summary Dashboard:** Assemble the most informative plots into a cohesive dashboard layout, providing a comprehensive overview of the data.
3. **Saving Visuals:** Ensure that the dashboard components are saved with clear and descriptive filenames.

---

**CODE:**

```python
# Box Plots of Numerical Features by Type
for feature in numerical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    sns.boxplot(x='type', y=feature, data=train_df, palette='Set2')
    plt.title(f'Box Plot of {feature} by Type')
    plt.xlabel('Type')
    plt.ylabel(feature)
    boxplot_type_path = os.path.join(images_dir, f'{feature}_boxplot_by_type.png')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig(boxplot_type_path)
    plt.close()
    print(f"Box plot for '{feature}' by 'type' saved to '{boxplot_type_path}'.")

# Violin Plots of Numerical Features by Type
for feature in numerical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    sns.violinplot(x='type', y=feature, data=train_df, palette='Set3')
    plt.title(f'Violin Plot of {feature} by Type')
    plt.xlabel('Type')
    plt.ylabel(feature)
    violinplot_type_path = os.path.join(images_dir, f'{feature}_violinplot_by_type.png')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig(violinplot_type_path)
    plt.close()
    print(f"Violin plot for '{feature}' by 'type' saved to '{violinplot_type_path}'.")

# Summary Dashboard: Assembling Key Plots
# Since creating a multi-plot dashboard programmatically can be complex and may exceed the image limit,
# we'll create individual key visuals and ensure the most insightful are highlighted.

print("\nKey insights visualizations have been saved individually in the images directory.")
```

**EXPLANATION:**

- **Box Plots by Type:** These plots help in comparing the distributions of numerical features across different creature types, highlighting central tendencies and variability.

- **Violin Plots by Type:** Combining the properties of box plots and density plots, violin plots offer a richer view of the data distribution per creature type.

- **Summary Dashboard:** While a consolidated dashboard can be beneficial, to adhere to the image limit and maintain clarity, we've saved individual key visualizations. These plots collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the data patterns and insights.

- **Saving Visuals:** Each plot is saved with a descriptive filename, ensuring that they can be easily identified and referenced during feature engineering and model building.

### Recommendations for Feature Engineering

Based on the in-depth EDA conducted, here are some recommendations for feature engineering:

1. **Interaction Terms:** Consider creating interaction features between highly correlated numerical variables (e.g., `bone_length * rotting_flesh`) to capture combined effects.

2. **Binning Numerical Features:** Transform continuous numerical features into categorical bins (e.g., quartiles) to simplify complex relationships and enhance model performance.

3. **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Implement one-hot encoding or target encoding for the `color` feature, especially if certain colors have strong associations with specific creature types.

4. **Polynomial Features:** Explore polynomial transformations of numerical features to capture non-linear relationships.

5. **Feature Scaling:** Ensure that numerical features are standardized or normalized, especially if using algorithms sensitive to feature scales.

6. **Dimensionality Reduction:** If multicollinearity is present, consider applying PCA or other dimensionality reduction techniques to extract salient features.

7. **Handling Imbalanced Classes:** If certain creature types are underrepresented, employ techniques like SMOTE or class weighting to address class imbalance.

Implementing these feature engineering strategies can enhance the predictive power of your models and contribute to better performance in the competition.
