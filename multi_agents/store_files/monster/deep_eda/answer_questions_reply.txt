### Question 1
**Statistical Summaries for Numerical Features:**
The following statistical summaries were generated for the numerical features (`bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`):

- **Descriptive Statistics**:
  - Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation, Variance, Skewness, Kurtosis, Minimum, Maximum, and Quartiles (25th, 50th, 75th percentiles).

**Insights on Scaling/Transformation Needs**:
- **Skewness**: If any feature has high skewness, it may benefit from a transformation (e.g., log transformation) to normalize the distribution.
- **Range**: Features with wide ranges (e.g., `has_soul` from 0.1 to 0.9) might need scaling (e.g., Min-Max scaling) to make them comparable.
- **Outliers**: Notable outliers could affect model performance and may need capping or removal.

### Question 2
**Patterns and Associations between Categorical Features**:
- The frequency distribution of `color` was analyzed, revealing counts and percentages for each category.
- A contingency table showed associations between `color` and `type`, indicating distinct relationships.

**Implications for Feature Creation**:
- If certain colors are predominantly associated with specific types, a new feature could be created that captures this association (e.g., a binary feature indicating if a color is rare or common for a type).

### Question 3
**Strong Correlations with Target Variable (`type`)**:
- The analysis of numerical features revealed correlations with `type`. Notably, visualizations such as box and violin plots indicated differences in means and distributions across types.

**Implications for Feature Selection**:
- Features with strong correlations (e.g., `bone_length` for Ghouls vs. Ghosts) should be prioritized for inclusion in the model, as they are likely to improve predictive power.

### Question 4
**Visual Insights from Analysis**:
- Violin plots for numerical features displayed distributions across different types, highlighting variations:
  - `bone_length`: Ghouls tend to have a longer bone length.
  - `rotting_flesh` and `has_soul`: Showed bimodal distributions, suggesting the presence of distinct groups within the data.
  
These visual insights help in understanding the variability and central tendencies of each feature concerning the target variable.

### Question 5
**Outliers Detection**:
- Box plots indicated the presence of outliers, particularly for `bone_length` in Ghouls, suggesting the need for engineering techniques.

**Recommended Actions**:
- Capping extreme values or removing outliers could be considered to prevent skewing model performance. Further investigation into the reasons for these outliers is recommended.

### Question 6
**Specific Feature Engineering Strategies**:
1. **Binning**: Create bins for continuous features like `bone_length` and `rotting_flesh` to capture non-linear relationships.
2. **Interaction Features**: Combine features such as `hair_length` and `has_soul` to create interaction terms, potentially improving model complexity.
3. **Encoding Categorical Features**: Use one-hot encoding or target encoding for `color` to capture its relationship with `type`.
4. **Normalization/Standardization**: Normalize features with different scales to ensure they contribute equally to distance calculations in algorithms.

These strategies aim to enhance model robustness and predictive power, leading to better performance in classification tasks.
