Based on the provided information and plan, here are six key questions designed to summarize the findings of the Data Cleaning phase and guide the transition to In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis:

### Key Questions

1. **What outlier handling techniques were applied to the numerical features, and what impact did they have on the datasets?**
   - *Purpose:* This question summarizes how outliers were treated (removed or clipped) and helps assess the impact of these decisions on the feature distributions, which is crucial for subsequent analysis.

2. **What categorical features were standardized across the training and testing datasets, and how were inconsistencies resolved?**
   - *Purpose:* Understanding the standardization process for categorical features (particularly `color`) ensures that the datasets are consistent, which is vital for accurate analysis and model performance.

3. **What proportion of the data was affected by the removal of duplicates, and how does this influence the integrity of the datasets?**
   - *Purpose:* Identifying the extent of duplicate records helps in understanding data integrity and potential impacts on the model training process.

4. **Were any missing values detected in the numerical or categorical features, and what strategies were employed to handle them?**
   - *Purpose:* This question highlights the handling of missing values, which is essential for the robustness of the dataset going into the exploratory analysis.

5. **What data types were validated or converted during the cleaning phase, and were there any discrepancies that needed attention?**
   - *Purpose:* This question focuses on ensuring that all features are of the correct type for analysis, as improper types can lead to errors in the subsequent exploratory phase.

6. **What overall patterns or anomalies were identified during data cleaning that should be explored further in the in-depth EDA?**
   - *Purpose:* This question encourages reflection on any interesting findings or anomalies that emerged during cleaning, guiding the focus of the exploratory data analysis to areas of potential significance.

These questions will help summarize the key findings from the Data Cleaning phase while providing a clear direction for the In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis phase.
