Understand Background\n2. Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis\n3. Data Cleaning\n4. In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis\n5. Feature Engineering\n6. Model Building, Validation, and Prediction\nCurrently, I am at phase: Data Cleaning.\n\n#############\n# INFORMATION #\nData preview:\n# Data Information\n\n## Data Type\n\n### ID type\n- `id`\n\n### Numerical type\n- `bone_length`\n- `rotting_flesh`\n- `hair_length`\n- `has_soul`\n\n### Categorical type\n- `color`\n\n### Datetime type\n- None\n\n## Detailed data description\n\nThe dataset consists of two parts: training data and test data.\n\n### Training Data\n- **Number of Samples:** 10\n- **Features:**\n  - **Numerical:**\n    - `bone_length`: Ranges from approximately 0.28 to 0.78\n    - `rotting_flesh`: Ranges from approximately 0.14 to 0.88\n    - `hair_length`: Ranges from approximately 0.18 to 0.81\n    - `has_soul`: Ranges from approximately 0.14 to 0.88\n  - **Categorical:**\n    - `color`: Includes values such as `clear`, `green`, `black`, `white`, and `blue`\n- **Target Variable:**\n  - `type`: Three classes - `Ghoul`, `Goblin`, `Ghost`\n  \n**Notable Patterns:**\n- The `Ghoul` class appears more frequently in the training data compared to `Goblin` and `Ghost`.\n- Numerical features show variability across different target classes, which may be indicative of underlying patterns useful for classification.\n\n### Test Data\n- **Number of Samples:** 10\n- **Features:**\n  - `id`, `bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`, `color`\n  \n**Observations:**\n- The test data mirrors the structure of the training data but excludes the target variable `type`.\n- Numerical feature ranges in the test set are consistent with those in the training set, ensuring compatibility for model predictions.\n\n## Target Variable\n\n- **Name:** `type`\n- **Description:** Categorical variable representing the creature type.\n- **Classes:**\n  - `Ghoul`\n  - `Goblin`\n  - `Ghost`\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\n\nThe submission file should be in CSV format with the following columns:\n\n- `id` (integer): Unique identifier for each data point.\n- `type` (string): Predicted class label, one of `Ghoul`, `Goblin`, or `Ghost`.\n\n**Example:**\n| id  | type   |\n|-----|--------|\n| 3   | Ghoul  |\n| 6   | Goblin |\n| ... | ...    |\n\nIn this phase, you have `train.csv` and `test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Address issues identified in the Preliminary EDA phase.\n2. Handle missing values using appropriate techniques.\n3. Treat outliers and anomalies.\n4. Ensure consistency across both datasets.\n5. Other necessary data cleaning steps.\n6.

        "content": "### **Data Cleaning Plan for \"ghouls_goblins_and_ghosts_boo\" Competition**\n\nTo ensure the integrity and quality of your datasets (`train.csv` and `test.csv`), the following **four** comprehensive tasks have been designed specifically for the Data Cleaning phase. Each task addresses critical aspects of your data, focusing on individual features and ensuring consistency across both datasets.\n\n---\n\n#### **Task 1: Detect and Handle Outliers in Numerical Features Using the IQR Method**\n\n**Objective:**  \nIdentify and manage outliers in the numerical features (`bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`) to enhance data quality and model performance.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Interquartile Range (IQR) for Each Numerical Feature:**\n   - **Action:** For each numerical feature, compute the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).\n   - **Tool:** Utilize Pandas\u2019 `quantile()` function.\n   - **Example Parameters:**\n     - `Q1 = data['bone_length'].quantile(0.25)`\n     - `Q3 = data['bone_length'].quantile(0.75)`\n\n2. **Determine Lower and Upper Boundaries:**\n   - **Action:** Calculate the IQR and define the lower and upper thresholds.\n   - **Formula:**\n     - `IQR = Q3 - Q1`\n     - `Lower Bound = Q1 - (1.5 * IQR)`\n     - `Upper Bound = Q3 + (1.5 * IQR)`\n\n3. **Identify Outliers:**\n   - **Action:** Flag data points that fall outside the lower and upper boundaries.\n   - **Tool:** Compare each data point against the calculated thresholds.\n   - **Example:**\n     - `outliers = data[(data['bone_length'] < Lower Bound) | (data['bone_length'] > Upper Bound)]`\n\n4. **Handle Outliers:**\n   - **Decision Criteria:**\n     - **Clipping:** Adjust outliers to the nearest boundary value.\n     - **Removal:** Exclude outlier data points from the dataset.\n   - **Recommendation:**  \n     - **Training Data:** Prefer removal if outliers significantly distort the data distribution.\n     - **Testing Data:** Prefer clipping to maintain dataset integrity for predictions.\n   - **Tool:** Use the `detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr` tool with the `method` parameter set appropriately.\n   - **Parameters Example:**\n     - `factor = 1.5`\n     - `method = 'remove'` for training data.\n     - `method = 'clip'` for testing data.\n\n**Features Involved:**  \n- `bone_length`\n- `rotting_flesh`\n- `hair_length`\n- `has_soul`\n\n**Expected Output:**  \n- **Cleaned Training Data:** Outliers removed, resulting in `cleaned_train.csv`.\n- **Cleaned Testing Data:** Outliers clipped, maintaining the original number of samples in `cleaned_test.csv`.\n\n**Constraints:**  \n- Ensure that clipping does not distort the feature distribution.\n- Avoid removing a substantial portion of the training data to prevent loss of valuable information.\n- Maintain consistency in outlier handling across both datasets to ensure model robustness.\n\n---\n\n#### **Task 2: Verify and Ensure Consistency in Categorical Features Across Datasets**\n\n**Objective:**  \nEnsure that the categorical feature `color` maintains consistent categories across both training and testing datasets to prevent discrepancies during model training and prediction.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify Unique Categories in Each Dataset:**\n   - **Action:** Extract unique values of the `color` feature from both `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`.\n   - **Tool:** Use Pandas\u2019 `unique()` function.\n   - **Example:**\n     - `train_colors = cleaned_train['color'].unique()`\n     - `test_colors = cleaned_test['color'].unique()`\n\n2. **Compare Categories Between Datasets:**\n   - **Action:** Determine if there are any categories present in one dataset but not the other.\n   - **Tool:** Utilize set operations.\n   - **Example:**\n     - `missing_in_test = set(train_colors) - set(test_colors)`\n     - `missing_in_train = set(test_colors) - set(train_colors)`\n\n3. **Standardize Categories:**\n   - **Action:** If discrepancies are found, standardize the `color` categories.\n   - **Methods:**\n     - **Mapping Missing Categories:** Assign a default category or map to an existing one.\n     - **Encoding Consistent Categories:** Ensure both datasets use the same encoding for categories.\n   - **Tool:** Apply Pandas\u2019 `replace()` or `map()` functions.\n   - **Example:**\n     - `cleaned_train['color'] = cleaned_train['color'].replace('blood', 'red')` (if standardizing to 'red')\n\n4. **Validate Consistency:**\n   - **Action:** Re-extract unique categories post-standardization to confirm consistency.\n   - **Tool:** Use Pandas\u2019 `unique()` function again.\n   - **Example:**\n     - `assert set(cleaned_train['color'].unique()) == set(cleaned_test['color'].unique())`\n\n**Features Involved:**  \n- `color`\n\n**Expected Output:**  \n- **Cleaned Training Data:** Standardized `color` categories in `cleaned_train.csv`.\n- **Cleaned Testing Data:** Standardized `color` categories in `cleaned_test.csv`.\n\n**Constraints:**  \n- Avoid introducing new categories that do not exist in the original datasets.\n- Ensure that the standardization process does not lead to loss of information or misrepresentation of data.\n- Maintain the integrity of the original categorical information during standardization.\n\n---\n\n#### **Task 3: Validate and Convert Data Types for All Features**\n\n**Objective:**  \nEnsure that each feature in both datasets has the appropriate data type to facilitate accurate analysis and model training.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Define Expected Data Types:**\n   - **Action:** Establish the correct data types for each feature based on the data description.\n   - **Mapping:**\n     - `id`: Integer (`int64`)\n     - `bone_length`: Floating-point (`float64`)\n     - `rotting_flesh`: Floating-point (`float64`)\n     - `hair_length`: Floating-point (`float64`)\n     - `has_soul`: Floating-point (`float64`)\n     - `color`: Categorical/Object (`object`)\n     - `type`: Categorical/Object (`object`) *(Only in training data)*\n\n2. **Inspect Current Data Types:**\n   - **Action:** Check the existing data types of each feature in both `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`.\n   - **Tool:** Use Pandas\u2019 `dtypes` attribute.\n   - **Example:**\n     - `cleaned_train.dtypes`\n     - `cleaned_test.dtypes`\n\n3. **Identify Mismatches and Convert Data Types:**\n   - **Action:** For any feature with an incorrect data type, perform the necessary conversion.\n   - **Tool:** Utilize the `convert_data_types` tool with appropriate parameters.\n   - **Conversion Examples:**\n     - Convert `id` to integer:\n       - `convert_data_types(data=cleaned_train, columns=['id'], target_type='int')`\n     - Convert `color` to string:\n       - `convert_data_types(data=cleaned_test, columns=['color'], target_type='str')`\n\n4. **Handle Conversion Errors:**\n   - **Action:** Manage any errors that arise during type conversion, such as non-numeric values in numerical columns.\n   - **Method:** Use the `errors='coerce'` parameter to handle invalid parsing gracefully.\n   - **Example:**\n     - `cleaned_train['bone_length'] = pd.to_numeric(cleaned_train['bone_length'], errors='coerce')`\n\n5. **Verify Successful Conversion:**\n   - **Action:** Re-inspect the data types post-conversion to confirm accuracy.\n   - **Tool:** Use Pandas\u2019 `dtypes` attribute again.\n   - **Example:**\n     - `assert cleaned_train['bone_length'].dtype == 'float64'`\n\n**Features Involved:**  \n- `id`\n- `bone_length`\n- `rotting_flesh`\n- `hair_length`\n- `has_soul`\n- `color`\n- `type` *(Training Data Only)*\n\n**Expected Output:**  \n- **Cleaned Training Data:** Correct data types for all features in `cleaned_train.csv`.\n- **Cleaned Testing Data:** Correct data types for all features in `cleaned_test.csv`.\n\n**Constraints:**  \n- Ensure that type conversions do not inadvertently introduce NaN values or errors.\n- Maintain consistency in data types across both datasets to prevent modeling issues.\n- Avoid altering the `type` feature in the testing data, as it does not exist there.\n\n---\n\n#### **Task 4: Confirm Absence of Duplicate Records**\n\n**Objective:**  \nEnsure that there are no duplicate entries in either dataset to maintain data integrity and prevent skewed model training.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Define Duplicate Criteria:**\n   - **Action:** Determine the basis for identifying duplicates. Common criteria include identical `id` values or identical sets of feature values.\n   - **Criteria Examples:**\n     - **Unique Identifier:** Duplicates based on the `id` column.\n     - **All Features:** Duplicates based on all feature columns excluding `type` for training data.\n\n2. **Check for Duplicates in Training Data:**\n   - **Action:** Identify any duplicate rows in `cleaned_train.csv`.\n   - **Tool:** Use Pandas\u2019 `duplicated()` function.\n   - **Example:**\n     - `duplicates_train = cleaned_train.duplicated(subset=['id'], keep=False)`\n\n3. **Check for Duplicates in Testing Data:**\n   - **Action:** Identify any duplicate rows in `cleaned_test.csv`.\n   - **Tool:** Use Pandas\u2019 `duplicated()` function.\n   - **Example:**\n     - `duplicates_test = cleaned_test.duplicated(subset=['id'], keep=False)`\n\n4. **Remove Duplicates if Found:**\n   - **Action:** Exclude duplicate rows from the datasets.\n   - **Tool:** Utilize the `remove_duplicates` tool with appropriate parameters.\n   - **Parameters Example:**\n     - `columns=['id']`\n     - `keep='first'`\n   - **Example:**\n     - `cleaned_train = remove_duplicates(data=cleaned_train, columns=['id'], keep='first')`\n     - `cleaned_test = remove_duplicates(data=cleaned_test, columns=['id'], keep='first')`\n\n5. **Verify Removal:**\n   - **Action:** Ensure that all duplicates have been successfully removed.\n   - **Tool:** Re-apply the `duplicated()` function and confirm no duplicates remain.\n   - **Example:**\n     - `assert not cleaned_train.duplicated(subset=['id']).any()`\n\n**Features Involved:**  \n- `id`\n- All feature columns (`bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`, `color`, `type`)\n\n**Expected Output:**  \n- **Cleaned Training Data:** No duplicate records in `cleaned_train.csv`.\n- **Cleaned Testing Data:** No duplicate records in `cleaned_test.csv`.\n\n**Constraints:**  \n- Ensure that the removal of duplicates does not lead to loss of unique information.\n- Preserve the first occurrence of a duplicate row as specified by the `keep` parameter.\n- Since the previous report indicates no duplicates, this step serves as a validation to confirm data integrity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Deliverables**\n\nUpon successful completion of the above tasks, you will have:\n\n1. **Cleaned Training Dataset:** `cleaned_train.csv` located at `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/ghouls_goblins_and_ghosts_boo/cleaned_train.csv`\n2. **Cleaned Testing Dataset:** `cleaned_test.csv` located at `/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/ghouls_goblins_and_ghosts_boo/cleaned_test.csv`\n\nThese cleaned datasets will be free from outliers, data type inconsistencies, duplicate records, and will maintain consistent categorical feature representations, thereby ensuring a robust foundation for subsequent phases of your data science competition.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \n- **Documentation:** Maintain detailed records of all data cleaning actions, including any assumptions or decisions made during the process. This documentation will be invaluable for transparency and future reference.\n- **Reproducibility:** Ensure that all data cleaning steps are scripted and reproducible to facilitate collaboration and iterative improvements."
