**Records:** 10\n  - **Features:**\n    - **Numerical:**\n      - `bone_length`: Values range from approximately 0.28 to 0.78.\n      - `rotting_flesh`: Values range from approximately 0.25 to 0.88.\n      - `hair_length`: Values range from approximately 0.17 to 0.81.\n      - `has_soul`: Values range from approximately 0.14 to 0.79.\n    - **Categorical:**\n      - `color`: Categories include clear, green, black, white, blue.\n      - `type`: Categories include Ghoul, Goblin, Ghost.\n  - **Distribution:**\n    - **Type Distribution:**\n      - Ghoul: 4 instances\n      - Goblin: 3 instances\n      - Ghost: 3 instances\n    - **Color Distribution:**\n      - clear: 2 instances\n      - green: 3 instances\n      - black: 3 instances\n      - white: 2 instances\n      - blue: 2 instances\n\n- **Testing Data:**\n  - **Records:** 10\n  - **Features:**\n    - **Numerical:**\n      - `bone_length`: Values range from approximately 0.29 to 0.64.\n      - `rotting_flesh`: Values range from approximately 0.31 to 0.68.\n      - `hair_length`: Values range from approximately 0.29 to 0.67.\n      - `has_soul`: Values range from approximately 0.10 to 0.70.\n    - **Categorical:**\n      - `color`: Categories include black, white, blue, clear.\n  - **Observations:**\n    - The testing data does not include the `type` feature as it is intended for prediction.\n    - `color` categories in the test set overlap with those in the training set.\n\n## Target Variable\n\n- **`type`**\n  - **Description:** The target variable represents the classification of each entity into one of three categories: Ghoul, Goblin, or Ghost.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\n\n- **File Format:** Typically CSV\n- **Required Columns:**\n  - `id` (Numeric): Unique identifier for each test data point.\n  - `type` (Categorical): Predicted class for each test data point (`Ghoul`, `Goblin`, or `Ghost`).\n\nExample:\n| id  | type   |\n|-----|--------|\n| 3   | Ghoul  |\n| 6   | Goblin |\n| ... | ...    |\n    </background_info>\n   <plan>\n## PLAN\n\n### STEP 1\nTask: Detect and Handle Outliers in Numerical Features Using the IQR Method\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tool:** `detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr`\n  - **Parameters for Training Data:**\n    - `columns`: [`bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`]\n    - `factor`: `1.5`\n    - `method`: `remove`\n  - **Parameters for Testing Data:**\n    - `columns`: [`bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`]\n    - `factor`: `1.5`\n    - `method`: `clip`\n- **Features Involved:** `bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- **Training Data:** Outliers are removed, resulting in a cleaned `cleaned_train.csv`.\n- **Testing Data:** Outliers are clipped to the nearest boundary values, maintaining the original sample size in `cleaned_test.csv`.\n\nConstraints:\n- Clipping should not distort the overall feature distribution.\n- Avoid removing a large portion of the training data to preserve valuable information.\n- Ensure consistent outlier handling between training and testing datasets to maintain model robustness.\n\n### STEP 2\nTask: Verify and Ensure Consistency in Categorical Features Across Datasets\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:**\n  - Pandas\u2019 `unique()` and `set` operations for identifying unique categories.\n  - Pandas\u2019 `replace()` or `map()` for standardizing categories.\n- **Features Involved:** `color`\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- **Both Datasets:** `color` categories are standardized and consistent across `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`.\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not introduce new categories that were not originally present.\n- Ensure that standardization does not lead to information loss or misrepresentation of the original data.\n- Maintain the integrity of categorical information during the standardization process.\n\n### STEP 3\nTask: Validate and Convert Data Types for All Features\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tool:** `convert_data_types`\n  - **Parameters:**\n    - `columns` and `target_type` for each feature:\n      - `id`: `int`\n      - `bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`: `float`\n      - `color`: `str`\n      - `type` (Training Data Only): `str`\n- **Additional Actions:**\n  - Use Pandas\u2019 `to_numeric()` with `errors='coerce'` for handling conversion errors.\n- **Features Involved:** `id`, `bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`, `color`, `type` (training only)\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- **Both Datasets:** All features have the correct and consistent data types in `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`.\n- **Data Integrity:** Minimizes errors during subsequent analysis and model training by ensuring appropriate data types.\n\nConstraints:\n- Prevent inadvertent introduction of NaN values or errors during type conversions.\n- Maintain consistent data types across both datasets to avoid modeling issues.\n- Do not alter the `type` feature in the testing data, as it does not exist there.\n\n### STEP 4\nTask: Confirm Absence of Duplicate Records\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tool:** `remove_duplicates`\n  - **Parameters:**\n    - `columns`: [`id`]\n    - `keep`: `first`\n- **Features Involved:** `id`, all other feature columns (`bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`, `color`, `type`)\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- **Both Datasets:** All duplicate records are removed, ensuring `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv` contain only unique entries.\n\nConstraints:\n- Preserve the first occurrence of any duplicate row as specified by the `keep` parameter.\n- Ensure that removing duplicates does not result in the loss of unique and valuable information.\n- Validate that no duplicates exist after the removal process, as indicated by previous reports.\n    </plan>\n</INPUT>\n<EXECUTION RESULT>\nCertainly!

These functions are referenced in the script but not defined within the provided code.\n\n2. **Libraries:** The script uses the `pandas` library. Make sure it is installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if it's not already installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pandas\n   ```\n\n3. **Error Handling:** The script includes try-except blocks to handle potential errors during data processing. Make sure to review any error messages for issues related to file paths, data formats, or function implementations.\n\n4. **Data Files:** Verify that the file paths specified in `data_dir` are correct and that the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files exist in the specified directory.\n\n5. **Data Consistency:** After processing, it's good practice to perform a final review of the cleaned data to ensure that all transformations have been applied correctly.\n\nIf you encounter any further issues or have additional questions, feel free to ask!\n</EXECUTION RESULT>\n\n"

Break down the task into smaller steps.\n2. For each step, ask yourself and answer:\n    - \"What is the objective of this step?\"\n    - \"What are the essential actions to achieve the objective?\"\n    - \"What features are involved in each action?\"\n    - \"Which tool can be used for each action? What are the parameters of the tool?\"\n    - \"What are the expected output of each action? What is the impact of the action on the data?\"\n    - \"What are the constraints of this step?\"\n\n</TASK>\n<INPUT>\n   <background_info>\nData preview:\n# Data Information\n\n## Data Type\n\n### ID type\n- `id`\n\n### Numerical type\n- `bone_length`\n- `rotting_flesh`\n- `hair_length`\n- `has_soul`\n\n### Categorical type\n- `color`\n\n### Datetime type\n- None\n\n## Detailed data description\n\nThe dataset consists of two parts: training data and test data.\n\n### Training Data\n- **Number of Samples:** 10\n- **Features:**\n  - **Numerical:**\n    - `bone_length`: Ranges from approximately 0.28 to 0.78\n    - `rotting_flesh`: Ranges from approximately 0.14 to 0.88\n    - `hair_length`: Ranges from approximately 0.18 to 0.81\n    - `has_soul`: Ranges from approximately 0.14 to 0.88\n  - **Categorical:**\n    - `color`: Includes values such as `clear`, `green`, `black`, `white`, and `blue`\n- **Target Variable:**\n  - `type`: Three classes - `Ghoul`, `Goblin`, `Ghost`\n  \n**Notable Patterns:**\n- The `Ghoul` class appears more frequently in the training data compared to `Goblin` and `Ghost`.\n- Numerical features show variability across different target classes, which may be indicative of underlying patterns useful for classification.\n\n### Test Data\n- **Number of Samples:** 10\n- **Features:**\n  - `id`, `bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`, `color`\n  \n**Observations:**\n- The test data mirrors the structure of the training data but excludes the target variable `type`.\n- Numerical feature ranges in the test set are consistent with those in the training set, ensuring compatibility for model predictions.\n\n## Target Variable\n\n- **Name:** `type`\n- **Description:** Categorical variable representing the creature type.\n- **Classes:**\n  - `Ghoul`\n  - `Goblin`\n  - `Ghost`\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\n\nThe submission file should be in CSV format with the following columns:\n\n- `id` (integer): Unique identifier for each data point.\n- `type` (string): Predicted class label, one of `Ghoul`, `Goblin`, or `Ghost`.\n\n**Example:**\n| id  | type   |\n|-----|--------|\n| 3   | Ghoul  |\n| 6   | Goblin |\n| ... | ...    |\n    </background_info>\n</INPUT>\n<EXECUTION RESULT>\n## PLAN\n\n### STEP 1\nTask: Detect and Handle Outliers in Numerical Features Using the IQR Method\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tool:** `detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr`\n  - **Parameters for Training Data:**\n    - `columns`: [`bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`]\n    - `factor`: `1.5`\n    - `method`: `remove`\n  - **Parameters for Testing Data:**\n    - `columns`: [`bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`]\n    - `factor`: `1.5`\n    - `method`: `clip`\n- **Features Involved:** `bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- **Training Data:** Outliers are removed, resulting in a cleaned `cleaned_train.csv`.\n- **Testing Data:** Outliers are clipped to the nearest boundary values, maintaining the original sample size in `cleaned_test.csv`.\n\nConstraints:\n- Clipping should not distort the overall feature distribution.\n- Avoid removing a large portion of the training data to preserve valuable information.\n- Ensure consistent outlier handling between training and testing datasets to maintain model robustness.\n\n### STEP 2\nTask: Verify and Ensure Consistency in Categorical Features Across Datasets\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:**\n  - Pandas\u2019 `unique()` and `set` operations for identifying unique categories.\n  - Pandas\u2019 `replace()` or `map()` for standardizing categories.\n- **Features Involved:** `color`\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- **Both Datasets:** `color` categories are standardized and consistent across `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`.\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not introduce new categories that were not originally present.\n- Ensure that standardization does not lead to information loss or misrepresentation of the original data.\n- Maintain the integrity of categorical information during the standardization process.\n\n### STEP 3\nTask: Validate and Convert Data Types for All Features\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tool:** `convert_data_types`\n  - **Parameters:**\n    - `columns` and `target_type` for each feature:\n      - `id`: `int`\n      - `bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`: `float`\n      - `color`: `str`\n      - `type` (Training Data Only): `str`\n- **Additional Actions:**\n  - Use Pandas\u2019 `to_numeric()` with `errors='coerce'` for handling conversion errors.\n- **Features Involved:** `id`, `bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`, `color`, `type` (training only)\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- **Both Datasets:** All features have the correct and consistent data types in `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`.\n- **Data Integrity:** Minimizes errors during subsequent analysis and model training by ensuring appropriate data types.\n\nConstraints:\n- Prevent inadvertent introduction of NaN values or errors during type conversions.\n- Maintain consistent data types across both datasets to avoid modeling issues.\n- Do not alter the `type` feature in the testing data, as it does not exist there.\n\n### STEP 4\nTask: Confirm Absence of Duplicate Records\nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tool:** `remove_duplicates`\n  - **Parameters:**\n    - `columns`: [`id`]\n    - `keep`: `first`\n- **Features Involved:** `id`, all other feature columns (`bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`, `color`, `type`)\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- **Both Datasets:** All duplicate records are removed, ensuring `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv` contain only unique entries.\n\nConstraints:\n- Preserve the first occurrence of any duplicate row as specified by the `keep` parameter.\n- Ensure that removing duplicates does not result in the loss of unique and valuable information.\n- Validate that no duplicates exist after the removal process, as indicated by previous reports.\n</EXECUTION RESULT>\n\n"
