Let's work through the problem step by step to identify and correct the error in the code snippet.

### Step 1: Analyze the Error

**Error Message:**
```
ValueError: Invalid method. Choose from 'clip' or 'remove'.
```

**Cause:**
The `detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr` function is being called with the parameter `method='cap'`. However, according to the tool's description, the valid options for the `method` parameter are `'clip'` or `'remove'`. The value `'cap'` is not recognized, leading to the `ValueError`.

### Step 2: Determine the Correction

Given that `'cap'` is not a valid option, we need to replace it with one of the allowed values:

- **'clip'**: Typically used to cap the outliers at a certain threshold.
- **'remove'**: Used to remove the outliers entirely from the dataset.

Based on the original intention to "handle" outliers without removing data entries (as suggested by previous comments in the code), the appropriate replacement is `'clip'`.

### Step 3: Correct the Code Snippet

**Original Code:**
```python
train_df = detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr(
    data=train_df.copy(),  # Work on a copy to preserve original data
    columns=numerical_cols,
    factor=3.0,              # Increased factor to reduce sensitivity
    method='cap'             # Changed method from 'remove' to 'cap'
)
```

**Corrected Code:**
```python
train_df = detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr(
    data=train_df.copy(),  # Work on a copy to preserve original data
    columns=numerical_cols,
    factor=3.0,              # Increased factor to reduce sensitivity
    method='clip'            # Changed method from 'remove' to 'clip'
)
```

### Final Corrected Code Snippet

```python
train_df = detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr(
    data=train_df.copy(),  # Work on a copy to preserve original data
    columns=numerical_cols,
    factor=3.0,              # Increased factor to reduce sensitivity
    method='clip'            # Changed method from 'remove' to 'clip'
)
```
