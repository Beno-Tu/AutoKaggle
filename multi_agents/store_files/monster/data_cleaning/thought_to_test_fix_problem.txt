Let's address the issue step by step to ensure that the data cleaning process aligns with the expected outcomes of the test cases.

### **1. Analysis of the Problem**

**Issue Identified:**
- **Test Case 35** expects the `cleaned_train.csv` to have the same number of rows as the original `train.csv` (371 rows). However, the current data cleaning process results in `cleaned_train.csv` having 366 rows, indicating that **5 rows are being removed** during outlier handling.

**Possible Causes:**
- **Method of Handling Outliers:** The current method uses `'remove'`, which **deletes rows containing outliers** based on the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. This direct removal can lead to unintended loss of data points, especially if the data has natural variability.
  
- **Factor Parameter:** The `factor=1.5` might be too aggressive for this specific dataset, leading to the removal of legitimate data points that are slightly beyond the typical IQR range.

- **Columns Targeted:** It's essential to ensure that only relevant numerical columns are being processed for outlier detection. Processing inappropriate columns (like IDs or categorical encoded as numerical) can mistakenly flag normal values as outliers.

### **2. Proposed Corrections**

To align the data cleaning process with the test case expectations, consider the following adjustments:

1. **Change the Outlier Handling Method:**
   - **From `'remove'` to `'cap'`:** Instead of removing rows with outliers, **cap** the outlier values at the calculated lower and upper bounds. This approach preserves all data points while mitigating the influence of extreme values.

2. **Adjust the Factor Parameter:**
   - **Increase the Factor:** A higher factor (e.g., `3.0`) makes the IQR method less sensitive, reducing the likelihood of flagging legitimate data points as outliers.

3. **Verify Target Columns:**
   - **Ensure Only Relevant Columns are Processed:** Double-check that `numerical_cols` accurately represents only those columns that should be subject to outlier detection.

4. **Add Logging for Transparency:**
   - **Inform About Capping Actions:** Including print statements or logging can help track how many values are being capped, providing better visibility during debugging.

### **3. Corrected Code Snippet**

Based on the above analysis and proposed corrections, here's the revised code:

```python
# Handle outliers in training data by capping them instead of removing
try:
    train_df = detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr(
        data=train_df.copy(),  # Work on a copy to preserve original data
        columns=numerical_cols,
        factor=3.0,              # Increased factor to reduce sensitivity
        method='cap'             # Changed method from 'remove' to 'cap'
    )
    print(f"Training data shape after handling outliers: {train_df.shape}")
    
    # Optional: Log the number of values capped per column
    for col in numerical_cols:
        # Assuming 'detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr' returns the capped DataFrame
        # and does not provide counts, we can compare before and after
        original_max = train_df_original[col].max()
        original_min = train_df_original[col].min()
        capped_max = train_df[col].max()
        capped_min = train_df[col].min()
        
        if capped_max < original_max or capped_min > original_min:
            print(f"Outliers in '{col}' capped to [{capped_min}, {capped_max}].")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error handling outliers in training data: {e}")
    raise
```

### **4. Additional Recommendations**

- **Backup Original Data:**
  - Before performing outlier handling, consider keeping a backup of the original `train_df` to facilitate comparisons and ensure data integrity.

- **Review `detect_and_handle_outliers_iqr` Function:**
  - Ensure that the function correctly implements the capping mechanism when `method='cap'` is specified.
  - Verify that the function returns the modified DataFrame as expected.

- **Validate `numerical_cols`:**
  - Ensure that `numerical_cols` excludes non-numerical or identifier columns to prevent erroneous outlier detection.

- **Run Tests Locally:**
  - After making these changes, execute the test cases locally to verify that `cleaned_train.csv` now retains 371 rows, as expected.

By implementing these corrections, the data cleaning process should preserve the intended number of rows while effectively managing outliers, thereby passing the specified test case.
