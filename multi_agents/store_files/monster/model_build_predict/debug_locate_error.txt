Based on the provided error message and the context of your code, the issue arises when attempting to save the submission file. The error message:

```
OSError: Cannot save file into a non-existent directory: '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/ghouls_goblins_and_ghosts_boo/model_build_predict/images'
```

indicates that the specified directory does not exist. The relevant code snippet causing this error is within the `create_submission` function, specifically the line where `to_csv` is called to save the submission file.

Here is the most relevant portion of your code that is causing the error:

```python
def create_submission(test_ids, predictions, submission_file_path):
    """
    Creates and saves the submission CSV file.
    """
    # Create the submission DataFrame
    submission_df = pd.DataFrame({
        'id': test_ids,
        'type': predictions
    })
    
    # Sanity check for missing values
    if submission_df['type'].isnull().sum() > 0:
        raise ValueError("There are missing values in the predictions.")
    
    # Display a sample of the submission
    print("Sample of Submission File:")
    print(submission_df.head())
    
    # Save the submission DataFrame to CSV
    submission_df.to_csv(submission_file_path, index=False)
    print(f"\nSubmission file saved successfully at {submission_file_path}")
```

**Key Lines Causing the Error:**

```python
# Save the submission DataFrame to CSV
submission_df.to_csv(submission_file_path, index=False)
```

**Explanation:**

- The function `create_submission` attempts to save the `submission_df` DataFrame to the path specified by `submission_file_path`.
- The error occurs because the directory specified in `submission_file_path` (`'/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/ghouls_goblins_and_ghosts_boo/model_build_predict/images'`) does not exist.
- When `to_csv` is called, Pandas tries to write the file to this directory but fails since the directory is missing.

**Next Steps:**

To resolve this issue, ensure that the target directory exists before attempting to save the file. You can add a few lines to create the directory if it doesn't exist using `os.makedirs` with the `exist_ok=True` parameter.

**Example Fix (Not part of the requested step):**

```python
import os

def create_submission(test_ids, predictions, submission_file_path):
    """
    Creates and saves the submission CSV file.
    """
    # Create the submission DataFrame
    submission_df = pd.DataFrame({
        'id': test_ids,
        'type': predictions
    })
    
    # Sanity check for missing values
    if submission_df['type'].isnull().sum() > 0:
        raise ValueError("There are missing values in the predictions.")
    
    # Display a sample of the submission
    print("Sample of Submission File:")
    print(submission_df.head())
    
    # Ensure the parent directory exists
    submission_dir = os.path.dirname(submission_file_path)
    os.makedirs(submission_dir, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Save the submission DataFrame to CSV
    submission_df.to_csv(submission_file_path, index=False)
    print(f"\nSubmission file saved successfully at {submission_file_path}")
```
