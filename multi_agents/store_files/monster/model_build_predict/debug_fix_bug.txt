Let's analyze and correct the provided error code snippet step by step.

### 1. **Analysis of the Error**

- **Error Message:**  
  ```
  OSError: Cannot save file into a non-existent directory: '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/ghouls_goblins_and_ghosts_boo/model_build_predict/images'
  ```
  
- **Cause:**  
  The error indicates that the code is attempting to save a CSV file to a path that refers to a **directory** (`.../images`) instead of a **file**. The `to_csv` method expects a file path including the filename (e.g., `.../images/submission.csv`), but it seems that `submission_file_path` is set to a directory path without specifying a filename.

### 2. **Correction Strategy**

- **Ensure `submission_file_path` Includes a Filename:**  
  Modify the `create_submission` function to check whether `submission_file_path` is a directory. If it is, append a default filename (e.g., `submission.csv`). This ensures that `to_csv` receives a valid file path.

- **Import Missing Libraries:**  
  The original snippet only imports `os` but uses `pandas` (as `pd`). To prevent potential `NameError` exceptions, ensure that `pandas` is imported.

### 3. **Corrected Code Snippet**

```python
import os
import pandas as pd

def create_submission(test_ids, predictions, submission_file_path):
    """
    Creates and saves the submission CSV file.

    Parameters:
    - test_ids (list or pd.Series): IDs for the test samples.
    - predictions (list or pd.Series): Predicted types for the test samples.
    - submission_file_path (str): Path to save the submission CSV file.
    """
    # Check if submission_file_path is a directory
    if os.path.isdir(submission_file_path):
        # Append default filename if a directory is provided
        submission_file_path = os.path.join(submission_file_path, 'submission.csv')
        print(f"submission_file_path is a directory. Using default filename: {submission_file_path}")
    else:
        # Ensure the parent directory exists
        submission_dir = os.path.dirname(submission_file_path)
        if submission_dir:  # Check if there is a parent directory
            os.makedirs(submission_dir, exist_ok=True)
            print(f"Ensured the directory exists: {submission_dir}")

    # Create the submission DataFrame
    submission_df = pd.DataFrame({
        'id': test_ids,
        'type': predictions
    })

    # Sanity check for missing values
    missing_values = submission_df['type'].isnull().sum()
    if missing_values > 0:
        raise ValueError(f"There are {missing_values} missing values in the predictions.")

    # Display a sample of the submission
    print("Sample of Submission File:")
    print(submission_df.head())

    # Save the submission DataFrame to CSV
    try:
        submission_df.to_csv(submission_file_path, index=False)
        print(f"\nSubmission file saved successfully at {submission_file_path}")
    except Exception as e:
        raise OSError(f"Failed to save submission file: {e}")
```

### **Explanation of Corrections**

1. **Importing `pandas`:**  
   Added `import pandas as pd` to ensure that the `pd` namespace is available for creating DataFrames.

2. **Handling `submission_file_path`:**  
   - **Directory Path Provided:**  
     The function checks if `submission_file_path` is a directory using `os.path.isdir()`. If it is, it appends a default filename (`submission.csv`) to the path.
     
   - **File Path Provided:**  
     If a file path is provided, the function ensures that the parent directory exists by creating it if necessary using `os.makedirs()`.

3. **Enhanced Error Handling:**  
   - **Missing Values Check:**  
     Improved the error message to specify the number of missing values.
     
   - **Try-Except Block for Saving CSV:**  
     Wrapped the `to_csv` operation in a `try-except` block to catch and raise more informative errors if the save operation fails for reasons other than the directory issue.

4. **Additional Documentation:**  
   Added parameter descriptions to the docstring for better clarity and maintainability.

### **Usage Example**

```python
# Example usage of create_submission
test_ids = [3, 6, 9, 10, 13]
predictions = ['Ghoul', 'Goblin', 'Ghoul', 'Ghost', 'Ghost']
submission_directory = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/ghouls_goblins_and_ghosts_boo/model_build_predict/images'

create_submission(test_ids, predictions, submission_directory)
```

- **Outcome:**  
  If `submission_directory` is a directory path, the function will save the submission as `submission.csv` within that directory. If a file path is provided (e.g., `.../images/my_submission.csv`), it will save the CSV to that exact location.
