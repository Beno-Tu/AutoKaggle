If not, create it to prevent any `FileNotFoundError`.\n  ```python\n  if not os.path.exists(submission_dir):\n      os.makedirs(submission_dir)\n  ```\n- **Handle Exceptions:** Incorporate try-except blocks to handle potential errors during the file-saving process, enhancing the robustness of your code.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the `submission.csv` file should be correctly saved in the specified directory, ensuring that all test cases pass successfully."
