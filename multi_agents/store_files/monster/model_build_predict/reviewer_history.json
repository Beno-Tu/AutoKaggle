Each data point is uniquely identified by an `id`. \n\n### Training Data\n- **Size:** 10 samples\n- **Classes:** \n  - **Ghoul:** 4 instances\n  - **Goblin:** 3 instances\n  - **Ghost:** 3 instances\n\n### Features:\n- **Hair and Soul Related:**\n  - `hair_length_has_soul`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`, `soul_to_hair_ratio`\n- **Bone Related:**\n  - `bone_to_flesh_ratio`, `bone_length`, `bone_length_squared`, `bone_length_rotting_flesh`\n- **Rotting Flesh Related:**\n  - `rotting_flesh`, `rotting_flesh_squared`\n\nMost features are continuous numerical values, some of which are engineered (e.g., squared terms, ratios). The distribution of feature values varies across classes, indicating potential patterns that can aid in classification. For instance, higher values in `soul_to_hair_ratio` and `bone_length_rotting_flesh` might correlate with specific creature types like Ghouls or Ghosts.\n\n### Testing Data\n- **Size:** 10 samples\n- **Features:** Same as training data, excluding the target variable `type`.\n\nThe test data mirrors the structure of the training data, ensuring consistency for model evaluation.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **Name:** `type`\n- **Description:** The class label representing the type of mythical creature. Possible categories include:\n  - **Ghoul**\n  - **Goblin**\n  - **Ghost**\n\nThe goal is to accurately classify each data point into one of these categories based on the provided features.\n\n# Submission Format\n\nThe submission file should follow the CSV format with the following columns:\n\n- `id` (Numerical): Unique identifier for each test data point.\n- `type` (Categorical): Predicted class label for the corresponding `id`. Must be one of the predefined categories (Ghoul, Goblin, Ghost).\n\n**Example:**\n```\nid,type\n3,Ghost\n6,Ghost\n9,Ghost\n10,Ghost\n13,Ghost\n14,Ghost\n15,Ghost\n16,Ghost\n17,Ghost\n18,Ghost\n```\n    </background_info>\n   <plan>\n## PLAN\n\n### STEP 1\nTask: **Data Preparation for Modeling**\n  \nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** Pandas (`pd.read_csv`, `df.pop`, `df.select_dtypes`, `df.drop`)\n- **Involved Features:**\n  - Training Set: `id`, `hair_length_has_soul`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`, `bone_to_flesh_ratio`, `bone_length`, `bone_length_squared`, `rotting_flesh`, `rotting_flesh_squared`, `soul_to_hair_ratio`, `bone_length_rotting_flesh`, `type`\n  - Test Set: `id`, `hair_length_has_soul`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`, `bone_to_flesh_ratio`, `bone_length`, `bone_length_squared`, `rotting_flesh`, `rotting_flesh_squared`, `soul_to_hair_ratio`, `bone_length_rotting_flesh`\n- **Parameters:**\n  - For separating target: `df.pop('type')`\n  - For selecting numeric columns: `df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])`\n  - For dropping `id`: `df.drop('id', axis=1)`\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- **Training Set:**\n  - `X_train`: DataFrame without the `type` column, containing only numeric features.\n  - `y_train`: Series containing the target variable `type`.\n- **Test Set:**\n  - `X_test`: DataFrame with the same numeric feature columns as `X_train`.\n  - `test_ids`: Series containing the `id` column for submission alignment.\n- **Impact:** Ensures that both training and testing datasets are clean, consistent, and ready for model training without irrelevant or non-numeric data interfering with the modeling process.\n\nConstraints:\n- Maintain alignment between `X_train` and `y_train` to ensure accurate model training.\n- Ensure that the test set undergoes identical column removal to maintain consistency with the training set.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 2\nTask: **Model Training and Validation**\n  \nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` function\n- **Involved Features:** All numeric features in `X_train`\n- **Parameters:**\n  - `X`: `X_train`\n  - `y`: `y_train`\n  - `problem_type`: `\"multiclass\"`\n  - `selected_models`: `[\"XGBoost\", \"SVM\", \"random forest\"]`\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- **Output:** Trained models (XGBoost, SVM, Random Forest) with associated performance metrics such as cross-validation accuracy scores.\n- **Impact:** Generates trained models capable of performing the classification task, with validated performance metrics to facilitate the selection of the best-performing model.\n\nConstraints:\n- Limit the number of models to a maximum of three due to computational resource restrictions.\n- Optimize model training configurations to balance performance and runtime efficiency, avoiding excessive hyperparameter tuning that could increase computation time.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 3\nTask: **Model Selection and Evaluation**\n  \nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** Outputs from `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` function\n- **Involved Features:** Performance metrics (e.g., accuracy scores) of each trained model\n- **Parameters:** None (manual or automated selection based on performance metrics)\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- **Output:** Identification of the best-performing model based on the highest cross-validation accuracy score (e.g., selecting XGBoost).\n- **Impact:** Selection of a reliable and accurate model that generalizes well to unseen data, ensuring robust performance in predictions.\n\nConstraints:\n- Prevent overfitting by favoring models that generalize consistently across cross-validation folds rather than those with the highest single-fold performance.\n- Ensure compatibility of the selected model with the test set features and preprocessing applied during training.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 4\nTask: **Prediction and Submission File Preparation**\n  \nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** Selected model's `predict` method, Pandas (`pd.DataFrame`, `df.to_csv`, `df.sample()`, `df.head()`)\n- **Involved Features:** All features present in `X_test`, `id` from `processed_test.csv`\n- **Parameters:** None (use default prediction settings unless specified)\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- **Predictions:** Predicted `type` labels for each entry in `X_test`.\n- **Submission File:** A CSV file (`submission.csv`) containing two columns:\n  - `id`: Corresponding to each test data point.\n  - `type`: Predicted category (`Ghoul`, `Goblin`, or `Ghost`).\n- **Impact:** Produces a compliant and accurate submission file ready for competition evaluation, ensuring correct alignment between `id`s and their corresponding predictions.\n\nConstraints:\n- Adhere strictly to the competition's CSV structure requirements, including correct column names and data types.\n- Maintain accurate alignment between `id`s and predicted `type` labels to prevent mismatches in the submission.\n- Perform sanity checks on the submission file to ensure format compliance and data accuracy.\n\n---\n    </plan>\n</INPUT>\n<EXECUTION RESULT>\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, StratifiedKFold\n\n# Assuming train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model is pre-imported and available\n\ndef load_and_prepare_data(data_dir, processed_train_file, processed_test_file):\n    \"\"\"\n    Loads the processed training and testing data, separates the target variable,\n    and prepares the feature sets for modeling.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    -

Each data point is uniquely identified by an `id`. The features are entirely numerical and appear to be engineered from original measurements, involving various ratios and polynomial transformations:\n\n- **Hair Attributes**: Includes `hair_length` and `hair_length_has_soul`, indicating possible interactions between hair length and the presence of a soul.\n- **Soul Attributes**: `has_soul` and `soul_to_hair_ratio` suggest measures of the creature's soul relative to other features.\n- **Bone Attributes**: Features like `bone_to_flesh_ratio`, `bone_length`, `bone_length_squared`, and `bone_length_rotting_flesh` capture the structural properties of the creature's anatomy.\n- **Flesh Attributes**: `rotting_flesh` and `rotting_flesh_squared` likely measure the state of the creature's flesh.\n\nNotable observations from the training data:\n- Ghouls and Goblins exhibit both positive and negative values across various features, indicating diversity within these classes.\n- Ghosts consistently show negative values in multiple features, which might be indicative of their ethereal nature.\n- Polynomial features (squared terms) suggest non-linear relationships between the original features and the target variable.\n\nThe dataset does not contain any datetime features. The absence of categorical features apart from the target variable implies that all predictive modeling will rely on numerical computations.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **`type`**: The target variable represents the classification of the creature. It is a categorical variable with the following classes:\n  - `Ghoul`\n  - `Goblin`\n  - `Ghost`\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should be a CSV with the following two columns:\n\n- `id` (integer): The unique identifier for each test data point.\n- `type` (string): The predicted category of the creature (`Ghoul`, `Goblin`, or `Ghost`).\n\n**Example:**\n```\nid,type\n3,Ghost\n6,Ghost\n9,Ghost\n10,Ghost\n13,Ghost\n14,Ghost\n15,Ghost\n16,Ghost\n17,Ghost\n18,Ghost\n```\n    </background_info>\n</INPUT>\n<EXECUTION RESULT>\n## PLAN\n\n### STEP 1\nTask: **Data Preparation for Modeling**\n  \nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** Pandas (`pd.read_csv`, `df.pop`, `df.select_dtypes`, `df.drop`)\n- **Involved Features:**\n  - Training Set: `id`, `hair_length_has_soul`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`, `bone_to_flesh_ratio`, `bone_length`, `bone_length_squared`, `rotting_flesh`, `rotting_flesh_squared`, `soul_to_hair_ratio`, `bone_length_rotting_flesh`, `type`\n  - Test Set: `id`, `hair_length_has_soul`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`, `bone_to_flesh_ratio`, `bone_length`, `bone_length_squared`, `rotting_flesh`, `rotting_flesh_squared`, `soul_to_hair_ratio`, `bone_length_rotting_flesh`\n- **Parameters:**\n  - For separating target: `df.pop('type')`\n  - For selecting numeric columns: `df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])`\n  - For dropping `id`: `df.drop('id', axis=1)`\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- **Training Set:**\n  - `X_train`: DataFrame without the `type` column, containing only numeric features.\n  - `y_train`: Series containing the target variable `type`.\n- **Test Set:**\n  - `X_test`: DataFrame with the same numeric feature columns as `X_train`.\n  - `test_ids`: Series containing the `id` column for submission alignment.\n- **Impact:** Ensures that both training and testing datasets are clean, consistent, and ready for model training without irrelevant or non-numeric data interfering with the modeling process.\n\nConstraints:\n- Maintain alignment between `X_train` and `y_train` to ensure accurate model training.\n- Ensure that the test set undergoes identical column removal to maintain consistency with the training set.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 2\nTask: **Model Training and Validation**\n  \nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` function\n- **Involved Features:** All numeric features in `X_train`\n- **Parameters:**\n  - `X`: `X_train`\n  - `y`: `y_train`\n  - `problem_type`: `\"multiclass\"`\n  - `selected_models`: `[\"XGBoost\", \"SVM\", \"random forest\"]`\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- **Output:** Trained models (XGBoost, SVM, Random Forest) with associated performance metrics such as cross-validation accuracy scores.\n- **Impact:** Generates trained models capable of performing the classification task, with validated performance metrics to facilitate the selection of the best-performing model.\n\nConstraints:\n- Limit the number of models to a maximum of three due to computational resource restrictions.\n- Optimize model training configurations to balance performance and runtime efficiency, avoiding excessive hyperparameter tuning that could increase computation time.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 3\nTask: **Model Selection and Evaluation**\n  \nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** Outputs from `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` function\n- **Involved Features:** Performance metrics (e.g., accuracy scores) of each trained model\n- **Parameters:** None (manual or automated selection based on performance metrics)\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- **Output:** Identification of the best-performing model based on the highest cross-validation accuracy score (e.g., selecting XGBoost).\n- **Impact:** Selection of a reliable and accurate model that generalizes well to unseen data, ensuring robust performance in predictions.\n\nConstraints:\n- Prevent overfitting by favoring models that generalize consistently across cross-validation folds rather than those with the highest single-fold performance.\n- Ensure compatibility of the selected model with the test set features and preprocessing applied during training.\n\n---\n\n### STEP 4\nTask: **Prediction and Submission File Preparation**\n  \nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** Selected model's `predict` method, Pandas (`pd.DataFrame`, `df.to_csv`, `df.sample()`, `df.head()`)\n- **Involved Features:** All features present in `X_test`, `id` from `processed_test.csv`\n- **Parameters:** None (use default prediction settings unless specified)\n\nExpected output or Impact on data:\n- **Predictions:** Predicted `type` labels for each entry in `X_test`.\n- **Submission File:** A CSV file (`submission.csv`) containing two columns:\n  - `id`: Corresponding to each test data point.\n  - `type`: Predicted category (`Ghoul`, `Goblin`, or `Ghost`).\n- **Impact:** Produces a compliant and accurate submission file ready for competition evaluation, ensuring correct alignment between `id`s and their corresponding predictions.\n\nConstraints:\n- Adhere strictly to the competition's CSV structure requirements, including correct column names and data types.\n- Maintain accurate alignment between `id`s and predicted `type` labels to prevent mismatches in the submission.\n- Perform sanity checks on the submission file to ensure format compliance and data accuracy.\n\n---\n</EXECUTION RESULT>\n\n"
