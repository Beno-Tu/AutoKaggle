Based on the error messages you've provided, it appears that the function `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` is returning more values than are being unpacked in your code. Specifically, the error message:

```
ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 3)
```

indicates that the function is returning more than three values, but only three variables are being used to capture them.

Additionally, there's an `IndentationError` that needs to be addressed to ensure the code runs correctly.

### Steps to Fix the Errors

1. **Adjust the Number of Variables During Unpacking:**

   First, determine how many values the function `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` is returning. You can do this by checking the function definition or by temporarily modifying the code to capture all returned values.

   For example, modify the unpacking line to capture all returned values as a single variable (like a tuple) to inspect them:

   ```python
   results = train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model(
       # your function arguments
   )
   print(results)  # This will help you see how many values are being returned
   ```

   Once you know the number of returned values, adjust the unpacking accordingly. For instance, if the function returns four values:

   ```python
   best_model, performance_metrics, additional_info, extra_detail = train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model(
       # your function arguments
   )
   ```

   If you only need certain values, you can unpack the necessary ones and ignore the others using the underscore (`_`) as a placeholder:

   ```python
   best_model, performance_metrics, additional_info, _ = train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model(
       # your function arguments
   )
   ```

2. **Fix the Indentation Error:**

   The `IndentationError: unexpected indent` suggests there's an incorrect indentation in your code. Ensure that all code blocks are properly indented using consistent spacing (preferably 4 spaces per indentation level).

   **Incorrect Indentation Example:**

   ```python
       best_model = train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model(
   ```

   **Correct Indentation Example:**

   ```python
   best_model = train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model(
       # your function arguments
   )
   ```

### Revised Code Snippet

Here's a revised version of the relevant part of your code with the adjustments:

```python
def generated_code_function():
    try:
        best_model, performance_metrics, additional_info, _ = train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model(
            # your function arguments
        )
        # Proceed with using best_model, performance_metrics, additional_info
    except ValueError as ve:
        print(f"ValueError encountered: {ve}")
    except IndentationError as ie:
        print(f"IndentationError encountered: {ie}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

### Additional Recommendations

- **Logging:** Implement logging to capture errors more effectively instead of using print statements. This will help in debugging and maintaining the code.
  
  ```python
  import logging

  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR, filename='error.log')

  def generated_code_function():
      try:
          best_model, performance_metrics, additional_info, _ = train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model(
              # your function arguments
          )
          # Proceed with using best_model, performance_metrics, additional_info
      except Exception as e:
          logging.error("An error occurred", exc_info=True)
  ```

- **Function Documentation:** Ensure that the `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` function has proper documentation indicating how many values it returns. This will prevent similar issues in the future.

By implementing these changes, you should be able to resolve the unpacking and indentation errors. If further issues arise, consider reviewing the entire function to ensure consistency between returned values and their handling.
