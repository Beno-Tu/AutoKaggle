Each data point is uniquely identified by an `id`. \n\n### Training Data\n- **Size:** 10 samples\n- **Classes:** \n  - **Ghoul:** 4 instances\n  - **Goblin:** 3 instances\n  - **Ghost:** 3 instances\n\n### Features:\n- **Hair and Soul Related:**\n  - `hair_length_has_soul`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`, `soul_to_hair_ratio`\n- **Bone Related:**\n  - `bone_to_flesh_ratio`, `bone_length`, `bone_length_squared`, `bone_length_rotting_flesh`\n- **Rotting Flesh Related:**\n  - `rotting_flesh`, `rotting_flesh_squared`\n\nMost features are continuous numerical values, some of which are engineered (e.g., squared terms, ratios). The distribution of feature values varies across classes, indicating potential patterns that can aid in classification. For instance, higher values in `soul_to_hair_ratio` and `bone_length_rotting_flesh` might correlate with specific creature types like Ghouls or Ghosts.\n\n### Testing Data\n- **Size:** 10 samples\n- **Features:** Same as training data, excluding the target variable `type`.\n\nThe test data mirrors the structure of the training data, ensuring consistency for model evaluation.\n\n## Target Variable\n- **Name:** `type`\n- **Description:** The class label representing the type of mythical creature. Possible categories include:\n  - **Ghoul**\n  - **Goblin**\n  - **Ghost**\n\nThe goal is to accurately classify each data point into one of these categories based on the provided features.\n\n# Submission Format\n\nThe submission file should follow the CSV format with the following columns:\n\n- `id` (Numerical): Unique identifier for each test data point.\n- `type` (Categorical): Predicted class label for the corresponding `id`. Must be one of the predefined categories (Ghoul, Goblin, Ghost).\n\n**Example:**\n```\nid,type\n3,Ghost\n6,Ghost\n9,Ghost\n10,Ghost\n13,Ghost\n14,Ghost\n15,Ghost\n16,Ghost\n17,Ghost\n18,Ghost\n```\nIn this phase, you have `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`. You should first train a model on the training set and then make predictions on the test set.\nBefore training the model:\n1. For the training set, separate the target column as y.\n2. Remove the target column and any non-numeric columns (e.g., String-type columns) that cannot be used in model training from the training set.\nBefore making predictions:\n1. For the test set, remove the same columns that were removed from the training set (except the target column, which is not present in the test set).\n2. Ensure consistency between the columns used in training and prediction.\nDue to computational resource limitations, you are allowed to train a maximum of **three** models\n#############\n# PLAN #\n## PLAN\n\n### STEP 1\nTask: **Data Preparation for Modeling**\n  \nTools, involved features and correct parameters:\n- **Tools:** Pandas (`pd.read_csv`, `df.pop`, `df.select_dtypes`, `df.drop`)\n- **Involved Features:**\n  -

`id`: Corresponding to each test data point.\n  - `type`: Predicted category (`Ghoul`, `Goblin`, or `Ghost`).\n- **Impact:** Produces a compliant and accurate submission file ready for competition evaluation, ensuring correct alignment between `id`s and their corresponding predictions.\n\nConstraints:\n- Adhere strictly to the competition's CSV structure requirements, including correct column names and data types.\n- Maintain accurate alignment between `id`s and predicted `type` labels to prevent mismatches in the submission.\n- Perform sanity checks on the submission file to ensure format compliance and data accuracy.\n\n---"

            "content": "Let's address your questions systematically based on the provided information.\n\n### Question 1\n**What models were trained during this phase, and what were their respective performance metrics?**\n\nThree models were trained during this phase:\n1. **XGBoost**\n   - Best Params: `{'learning_rate': 0.1, 'max_depth': 3, 'n_estimators': 50}`\n   - Score: 0.7254 (cross-validation accuracy)\n\n2. **SVM**\n   - Best Params: `{'C': 0.1, 'gamma': 'scale', 'kernel': 'linear'}`\n   - Score: 0.6795 (cross-validation accuracy)\n\n3. **Random Forest**\n   - Best Params: `{'max_depth': 10, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 10}`\n   - Score: 0.6961 (cross-validation accuracy)\n\n### Question 2\n**Which model was selected as the best-performing model, and what criteria were used for this selection?**\n\nThe best-performing model selected was **XGBoost**, based on the highest cross-validation accuracy score of **0.7254** compared to the other models. The selection was made by evaluating the cross-validation accuracy scores from the training phase.\n\n### Question 3\n**What preprocessing steps were applied to the training and test sets to ensure consistency, and how did these affect the model's performance?**\n\nThe following preprocessing steps were taken to ensure consistency:\n- The target column `type` was separated from the training set and stored in `y_train`.\n- The `id` column was removed from both the training and test sets to avoid interference during modeling.\n- Consistency was ensured by checking that the feature columns in `X_train` and `X_test` were identical.\n\nThis preprocessing ensured that only relevant numeric features were used for training, likely contributing to the model's performance by reducing noise and potential overfitting.\n\n### Question 4\n**What were the key challenges encountered during model training and validation, and how were they addressed?**\n\nKey challenges included:\n- **Limited Data**: With only 10 samples in the test set and 371 in the training set, the models may not generalize well. This was addressed by implementing cross-validation during model evaluation to better estimate model performance on unseen data.\n- **Model Selection**: Choosing the best model among three candidates required efficient validation. This was resolved by using a structured training and validation function to streamline the process and ensure robust performance evaluation.\n\n### Question 5\n**How were the predictions generated for the test set, and what steps were taken to validate the submission format?**\n\nPredictions were generated using the best model (XGBoost) with the following steps:\n1. The trained model was applied to `X_test` to generate predictions.\n2. A submission DataFrame was created with `id` and the corresponding predicted `type`.\n3. A sanity check was performed to ensure there were no missing values in the predictions.\n4. The submission file was saved in the required CSV format, ensuring compliance with the competition's specifications.\n\n### Question 6\n**What recommendations can be made based on the model's performance and the overall workflow of this phase for future competitions or similar tasks?**\n\nRecommendations include:\n1. **Enhance Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling to validate input data formats and catch potential runtime errors.\n2. **Include Additional Metrics**: Provide comprehensive performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score during model validation to gain a better understanding of model performance.\n3. **Implement Logging**: Replace print statements with a logging mechanism to improve execution tracking and facilitate debugging.\n4. **Experiment with More Models**: If resources allow, consider experimenting with additional models or hyperparameter tuning to potentially improve performance.\n5. **Data Augmentation**: In cases of limited data, explore techniques for data augmentation to enhance the training dataset.\n\nThese suggestions can help improve future modeling efforts and overall competition performance."
