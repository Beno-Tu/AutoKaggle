Good luck!\n\nStart\n\nMar 1, 2024\n\n###### Close\n\nApr 1, 2024\n\n### Evaluation\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nSubmissions are evaluated using\u00a0[area under the ROC curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)\u00a0using the predicted probabilities and the ground truth targets.\n\nTo calculate the final score, AUC is calculated for each of the 7 defect categories and then averaged. In other words, the score is the average of the individual AUC of each predicted column.\n\n## Submission File\n\nFor each\u00a0`id`\u00a0in the test set, you must predict the probability for each of 7 defect categories:\u00a0`Pastry`,\u00a0`Z_Scratch`,\u00a0`K_Scatch`,\u00a0`Stains`,\u00a0`Dirtiness`,\u00a0`Bumps`,\u00a0`Other_Faults`. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nid,Pastry,Z_Scratch,K_Scatch,Stains,Dirtiness,Bumps,Other_Faults\n19219,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5\n19220,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5\n19221,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5\netc.\n```\n\n### Timeline\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\n- **Start Date**\u00a0- March 1, 2024\n- **Entry Deadline**\u00a0- Same as the Final Submission Deadline\n- **Team Merger Deadline**\u00a0- Same as the Final Submission Deadline\n- **Final Submission Deadline**\u00a0- March 31, 2024\n\nAll deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.\n\n### About the Tabular Playground Series\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nThe goal of the Tabular Playground Series is to provide the Kaggle community with a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge. The challenges will generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\n### Synthetically-Generated Datasets\n\nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\n### Prizes\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\n- 1st Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise\n- 2nd Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise\n- 3rd Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise\n\n**Please note:**\u00a0In order to encourage more participation from beginners, Kaggle merchandise will only be awarded once per person in this series. If a person has previously won, we'll skip to the next team.\n\n### Citation\n\nlink\n\nkeyboard_arrow_up\n\nWalter Reade, Ashley Chow. (2024). Steel Plate Defect Prediction.

Each data point includes both numerical and categorical features that might be indicative of the quality of the steel plates. Numerical features represent measurements such as minimum and maximum coordinates, pixel areas, luminosity values, and indices related to edges and shapes. Categorical features indicate the presence of various faults or types of steel.\n\nThe training data contains labels for different types of faults, while the test data does not. The target variables (faults) include `Pastry`, `Z_Scratch`, `K_Scatch`, `Stains`, `Dirtiness`, `Bumps`, and `Other_Faults`. \n\nNotably, the dataset appears to contain a mix of normal and defective samples, providing a basis for classification tasks. \n\n## Target Variable\nThe target variables are:\n- `Pastry`: Indicates the presence of pastry-like defects.\n- `Z_Scratch`: Indicates the presence of Z-scratch defects.\n- `K_Scatch`: Indicates the presence of K-scatch defects.\n- `Stains`: Indicates the presence of stains on the steel plate.\n- `Dirtiness`: Indicates dirtiness present on the steel plate surface.\n- `Bumps`: Indicates the presence of bumps on the steel plate.\n- `Other_Faults`: Indicates any other types of faults not classified above.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should consist of the following columns:\n- `id` (int): Unique identifier for each data point.\n- `Pastry` (int): Binary indicator (0 or 1) for the presence of pastry defects.\n- `Z_Scratch` (int): Binary indicator (0 or 1) for the presence of Z-scratch defects.\n- `K_Scatch` (int): Binary indicator (0 or 1) for the presence of K-scatch defects.\n- `Stains` (int): Binary indicator (0 or 1) for the presence of stains.\n- `Dirtiness` (int): Binary indicator (0 or 1) for the presence of dirtiness.\n- `Bumps` (int): Binary indicator (0 or 1) for the presence of bumps.\n- `Other_Faults` (int): Binary indicator (0 or 1) for the presence of other faults."
