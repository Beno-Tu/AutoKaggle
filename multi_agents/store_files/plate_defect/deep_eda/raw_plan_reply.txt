Thank you for providing the detailed report and information. Based on the context and your current phase of the project, here is a specific plan for the In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase:

### In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis Plan

#### Task 1: Conduct Thorough Statistical Analysis on Cleaned Data
**Objective:** Obtain a detailed statistical overview of the numerical and categorical features.
**Actions:**
1. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Use pandas' `describe()` method to get mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles for numerical features.
   - Use pandas' `value_counts()` for categorical features to understand the distribution.
   - **Features Involved:** All numerical and categorical features.
   - **Tools:** Pandas
   - **Expected Output:** Summary statistics for numerical features and frequency distribution for categorical features.
   - **Constraints:** Ensure no modifications to the dataset, only analysis.
   
2. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Compute the correlation matrix using pandas' `corr()` method to identify relationships between numerical features.
   - Visualize the correlation matrix using seaborn's `heatmap()`.
   - **Features Involved:** All numerical features.
   - **Tools:** Pandas, Seaborn
   - **Expected Output:** Correlation matrix and heatmap visualization.
   - **Constraints:** Limit the image generation to one heatmap for efficiency.

#### Task 2: Explore Relationships Between Features and Target Variables
**Objective:** Understand how each feature relates to the target variables.
**Actions:**
1. **Univariate Analysis:**
   - Plot histograms and boxplots for each numerical feature, stratified by each target variable.
   - Use count plots for categorical features, stratified by each target variable.
   - **Features Involved:** All numerical and categorical features.
   - **Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
   - **Expected Output:** Histograms, boxplots, and count plots showing distributions and potential correlations.
   - **Constraints:** Limit generated images to a maximum of 10, focusing on key features and target variables with the most variance.

2. **Bivariate Analysis:**
   - Perform pairwise scatter plots for numerical features against target variables.
   - Use Seaborn's pairplot or scatterplot with hue set to target variables.
   - **Features Involved:** All numerical features.
   - **Tools:** Seaborn
   - **Expected Output:** Scatter plots highlighting relationships between features and target variables.
   - **Constraints:** Ensure efficient plotting, avoid overloading with too many plots.

#### Task 3: Identify Potential Feature Interactions
**Objective:** Identify interactions between features that could be significant for model building.
**Actions:**
1. **Interaction Plots:**
   - Create interaction plots for pairs of features to see if the relationship between one feature and the target variable depends on the value of another feature.
   - Use Seaborn's `lmplot()` or `interaction_plot()` from statsmodels.
   - **Features Involved:** Selected pairs of numerical features.
   - **Tools:** Seaborn, Statsmodels
   - **Expected Output:** Plots showing potential feature interactions.
   - **Constraints:** Focus on key interactions that show significant variance.

2. **Cross-Tabulation:**
   - Perform cross-tabulation for categorical features to explore interactions between them and target variables.
   - Use pandas' `crosstab()` function.
   - **Features Involved:** Categorical features.
   - **Tools:** Pandas
   - **Expected Output:** Cross-tabulation tables showing interaction frequencies.
   - **Constraints:** Keep tables concise and focused on significant interactions.

#### Task 4: Visualize Key Insights and Patterns
**Objective:** Summarize and visualize the key insights and patterns discovered during the analysis.
**Actions:**
1. **Summary Plots:**
   - Create summary plots to visualize the most significant findings from the analysis.
   - Use bar plots, line plots, or heatmaps as needed.
   - **Features Involved:** All key features identified from previous tasks.
   - **Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
   - **Expected Output:** Summary visualizations showing key patterns and insights.
   - **Constraints:** Ensure clarity and avoid redundancy in visualizations.

2. **Recommendations for Feature Engineering:**
   - Based on insights from the EDA, provide recommendations for potential feature engineering steps.
   - **Features Involved:** All relevant features.
   - **Tools:** Text-based summary
   - **Expected Output:** A list of actionable recommendations for feature engineering.
   - **Constraints:** Focus on practical and impactful feature engineering steps.

By following this plan, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of the data, identify important relationships and interactions, and visualize key insights that will guide the next phase of feature engineering and model building.
