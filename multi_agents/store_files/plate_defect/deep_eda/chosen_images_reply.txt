To effectively conduct in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the "plate_defect" competition, it's important to select images that provide insights into various aspects of the data. Hereâ€™s a logical selection based on what would be most relevant for in-depth EDA:

1. **Boxplots**: These will help us understand the distribution and variability of different defects in relation to pixel areas.
   - `boxplot_Pixels_Areas_Bumps.png`
   - `boxplot_Pixels_Areas_Dirtiness.png`
   - `boxplot_Pixels_Areas_K_Scatch.png`
   - `boxplot_Pixels_Areas_Stains.png`
   - `boxplot_X_Maximum_Bumps.png`

2. **Histograms**: These will visualize the frequency distribution of pixel areas for each defect type, allowing for a deeper understanding of their distributions.
   - `hist_Pixels_Areas_Bumps.png`
   - `hist_Pixels_Areas_Dirtiness.png`
   - `hist_Pixels_Areas_Stains.png`

3. **Correlation Matrix**: Understanding the correlations between different features is crucial for feature engineering later on.
   - `correlation_matrix_heatmap.png`

Based on this analysis, here are the selected images:

```json
{
    "images": [
        "boxplot_Pixels_Areas_Bumps.png",
        "boxplot_Pixels_Areas_Dirtiness.png",
        "boxplot_Pixels_Areas_K_Scatch.png",
        "boxplot_Pixels_Areas_Stains.png",
        "boxplot_X_Maximum_Bumps.png",
        "hist_Pixels_Areas_Bumps.png",
        "hist_Pixels_Areas_Dirtiness.png",
        "correlation_matrix_heatmap.png"
    ]
}
```
