Scatter plots highlighting relationships between features and target variables.\n- **Constraints:**\n  - Limit generated images to a maximum of 10, focusing on key features and target variables with the most variance.\n  - Ensure efficient plotting, avoid overloading with too many plots.\n\n### STEP 3\nTask: Identify Potential Feature Interactions\n- **Tools, Involved Features, and Correct Parameters:**\n  - Create interaction plots for pairs of features using Seaborn's `lmplot()` or `interaction_plot()` from statsmodels.\n  - Perform cross-tabulation for categorical features using pandas' `crosstab()`.\n  - **Features Involved:** Selected pairs of numerical features and categorical features.\n- **Expected Output or Impact on Data:**\n  - Interaction plots showing potential feature interactions.\n  - Cross-tabulation tables showing interaction frequencies.\n- **Constraints:**\n  - Focus on key interactions that show significant variance.\n  - Keep tables concise and focused on significant interactions.\n\n### STEP 4\nTask: Visualize Key Insights and Patterns\n- **Tools, Involved Features, and Correct Parameters:**\n  - Create summary plots using bar plots, line plots, or heatmaps as needed with Matplotlib and Seaborn.\n  - Provide recommendations for potential feature engineering steps.\n  - **Features Involved:** All key features identified from previous tasks.\n- **Expected Output or Impact on Data:**\n  - Summary visualizations showing key patterns and insights.\n  - A list of actionable recommendations for feature engineering.\n- **Constraints:**\n  - Ensure clarity and avoid redundancy in visualizations.\n  - Focus on practical and impactful feature engineering steps.\n</EXECUTION RESULT>\n\n"
