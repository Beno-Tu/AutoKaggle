## IMAGE: boxplot_Pixels_Areas_Bumps.png ##
The image is a boxplot that visualizes the distribution of the variable "Pixels_Areas" stratified by the variable "Bumps." The boxplot separates the data into two groups based on the presence (1) or absence (0) of bumps.

Here is a detailed description of the image:

1. **Axes**:
   - **X-axis**: Represents the categorical variable "Bumps" with two levels: 0 (no bumps) and 1 (with bumps).
   - **Y-axis**: Represents the "Pixels_Areas" values ranging from 0 to approximately 1500.

2. **Boxplot Details**:
   - **Group 0 (No Bumps)**:
     - The box plot for this group is significantly stretched, indicating a wide distribution of the "Pixels_Areas" values.
     - The median (the line inside the box) is relatively low, indicating that half of the values are below a low threshold.
     - The interquartile range (IQR), represented by the height of the box, is quite large.
     - There are no apparent outliers in this group.
   - **Group 1 (With Bumps)**:
     - The box plot is much more compact compared to group 0, indicating a narrower distribution of the "Pixels_Areas" values.
     - The median is higher than that of group 0, suggesting that the central tendency is higher for this group.
     - The IQR is relatively small, indicating less variability within this group.
     - There are many outliers above the upper whisker, showing that there are several instances where the "Pixels_Areas" values are unusually high compared to the rest of the data in this group.

3. **Insights**:
   - The "Pixels_Areas" values are generally higher and more widely spread when there are no bumps (group 0) compared to when there are bumps (group 1).
   - The presence of numerous outliers in the group with bumps (group 1) indicates that there are several instances where the "Pixels_Areas" values are significantly higher than the rest of the data in that group. This could suggest that while the typical pixel area is lower in the presence of bumps, there are occasional instances of much higher values.
   - The wide distribution in the no bumps group (group 0) could suggest that the absence of bumps allows for a greater variability in pixel areas, possibly due to fewer constraints on the pixel area measurements.

Overall, the boxplot reveals that the distribution of "Pixels_Areas" is heavily influenced by the presence or absence of bumps, with distinct characteristics in terms of central tendency, variability, and outliers.
## IMAGE: boxplot_Pixels_Areas_Dirtiness.png ##
The image depicts a boxplot of pixel areas stratified by two categories of "Dirtiness" (0 and 1). Here is a detailed description and analysis of the boxplot:

### Detailed Description of the Boxplot

1. **Axes**:
   - The x-axis represents the "Dirtiness" categories, with two values: 0 and 1.
   - The y-axis represents the "Pixels_Areas" values, ranging from 0 to approximately 1500.

2. **Boxplot Components**:
   - Each boxplot shows the distribution of pixel areas for the respective dirtiness category.
   - The box represents the interquartile range (IQR) from the 25th percentile (Q1) to the 75th percentile (Q3).
   - The line inside the box represents the median (50th percentile).
   - The "whiskers" extend from the box to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 times the IQR from Q1 and Q3, respectively.
   - Data points outside this range are considered outliers and are marked as individual points.

### Analysis of the Data

1. **Central Tendency**:
   - The median pixel areas for both dirtiness categories appear to be similar, both lying around the same value (around 200).

2. **Spread and Variability**:
   - The IQR for both categories is similar, indicating a comparable spread in the middle 50% of data points.
   - For both categories, the whiskers extend to similar ranges, suggesting similar variability.
   - There are outliers in both categories, which extend beyond the whiskers.

3. **Outliers**:
   - Both categories have outliers, with pixel areas reaching up to approximately 1400-1500. 
   - These outliers indicate that there are some unusually large pixel areas in both categories.

4. **Symmetry and Skewness**:
   - Both boxplots seem to be fairly symmetrical, indicating a balanced distribution of pixel areas around the median.
   - The whiskers are also roughly equal in length on both sides of the boxes for each dirtiness category, suggesting minimal skewness.

### Insights

1. **Homogeneity Across Dirtiness Categories**:
   - The distribution of pixel areas is quite similar for both dirtiness categories, suggesting that dirtiness (as defined by categories 0 and 1) does not significantly affect the pixel area.

2. **Presence of Large Pixel Areas**:
   - The presence of outliers in both categories indicates that there are instances of significantly larger pixel areas, which could merit further investigation. These outliers might be due to errors, unique cases, or specific conditions that need to be examined individually.

3. **Potential Further Analysis**:
   - It might be beneficial to investigate any underlying factors that contribute to these outliers.
   - Additionally, analyzing other variables in conjunction with "Pixels_Areas" and "Dirtiness" might provide more insights into the relationships and patterns within the data.

Overall, while the dirtiness categories do not seem to affect the central tendency and variability of pixel areas significantly, the presence of outliers in both categories indicates that some data points deviate substantially from the norm, warranting further investigation.
## IMAGE: boxplot_Pixels_Areas_K_Scatch.png ##
The image shows a boxplot titled "Boxplot of Pixels_Areas stratified by K_Scatch." The boxplot represents the distribution of the variable "Pixels_Areas" for two groups based on the variable "K_Scatch," with "0" and "1" as the two categories.

Here is a detailed description of the boxplot:

### Description:
1. **Axes:**
   - The x-axis represents the variable "K_Scatch," with two distinct categories: 0 and 1.
   - The y-axis represents the variable "Pixels_Areas."

2. **Boxplot for K_Scatch = 0:**
   - The box represents the interquartile range (IQR), which contains the middle 50% of the data.
   - The bottom edge of the box (Q1) is around 100.
   - The top edge of the box (Q3) is around 200.
   - The median (Q2) is approximately at 150.
   - The whiskers extend from roughly 0 to 400, suggesting that the majority of the data falls within this range.
   - There are many outliers above 400, with values reaching beyond 1400.

3. **Boxplot for K_Scatch = 1:**
   - The box is a thin line, suggesting very little variance in the middle 50% of the data.
   - The median (Q2) is approximately at 150.
   - The whiskers extend from around 0 to 1500, indicating a wide range of data.
   - There are many outliers above 400, similar to the group where K_Scatch = 0.

### Insights:
1. **Distribution:**
   - For K_Scatch = 0, the distribution of "Pixels_Areas" shows a wider IQR compared to K_Scatch = 1, indicating more variability within this group.
   - The median value for both groups is similar, around 150.

2. **Outliers:**
   - Both groups have a significant number of outliers above 400, indicating that while the bulk of the data lies within a lower range, there are extreme values present in both groups.
  
3. **Variability:**
   - K_Scatch = 1 shows less variability in the middle 50% of its data compared to K_Scatch = 0, but overall, it has a wide range of values.

4. **Potential Insights:**
   - The similarity in medians suggests that the central tendency for "Pixels_Areas" is not largely influenced by the K_Scatch classification.
   - The difference in variability might indicate different distributions or data characteristics between the two groups. For example, K_Scatch = 1 might have more consistent pixel areas, while K_Scatch = 0 has more variability in pixel areas.
   - The presence of many outliers in both groups suggests that there might be a need for further investigation into why these extreme values exist and whether they represent anomalies or are genuine data points.

These insights could be useful for understanding the distribution and variability of pixel areas depending on the K_Scatch classification. Further analysis might be required to explore the reasons behind the outliers and the observed variability.
## IMAGE: boxplot_Pixels_Areas_Stains.png ##
This boxplot shows the distribution of "Pixels_Areas" stratified by "Stains," where the x-axis represents the stains (0 and 1) and the y-axis represents the pixel areas. Here's a detailed breakdown of the image:

### Data Distribution:

1. **Stain 0 (Left Boxplot)**:
   - **Median**: The median value of the pixel areas is slightly above 200.
   - **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The IQR, which is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3), appears to be from approximately 100 to 600.
   - **Whiskers**: The lower whisker extends down to near 0, and the upper whisker extends up to around 1400, indicating a wide range of pixel areas.
   - **Outliers**: There are no apparent outliers for this category.
   
2. **Stain 1 (Right Boxplot)**:
   - **Median**: The median pixel area for this category is much lower, around 5.
   - **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The IQR is very narrow, ranging from approximately 2 to 15.
   - **Whiskers**: The whiskers for this category are short, indicating a very tight distribution of pixel areas. The lower whisker is near 0, and the upper whisker is around 25.
   - **Outliers**: There are several outliers above the upper whisker, indicating some pixel areas are significantly higher than the majority in this category.

### Insights:

1. **Distribution Differences**:
   - The pixel areas for stains categorized as 0 have a much wider distribution compared to those categorized as 1. This indicates that the areas covered by pixels in the "Stain 0" category are significantly more variable.
   - The pixel areas in the "Stain 1" category are mostly concentrated around lower values, showing a much more consistent and smaller area coverage.

2. **Central Tendency and Spread**:
   - The central tendency (median) for "Stain 0" is much higher compared to "Stain 1". This suggests that, on average, the pixel areas for "Stain 0" are larger.
   - The spread for "Stain 0" is vastly larger, indicating that there is more variability in the pixel areas compared to "Stain 1".

3. **Potential Outliers**:
   - The presence of outliers in the "Stain 1" category suggests that while most of the pixel areas are small, there are occasional instances where the pixel area is considerably larger.

### Conclusion:
The data reveals a clear distinction between the pixel areas associated with the two stain categories. "Stain 0" has a broader and larger range of pixel areas, while "Stain 1" is characterized by consistently smaller pixel areas with a few larger outliers. This could indicate different staining behaviors or properties that result in varying pixel area distributions. Further investigation into the nature of these stains could provide more insights into the causes of these differences.
## IMAGE: boxplot_X_Maximum_Bumps.png ##
### Description of the Boxplot

This boxplot presents the distribution of the variable "X_Maximum" stratified by the variable "Bumps", which has two categories: 0 and 1.

1. **Boxplot Structure:**
    - The box represents the interquartile range (IQR), which contains the middle 50% of the data.
    - The line inside the box represents the median (50th percentile).
    - The "whiskers" extend from the box to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 * IQR from the lower and upper quartiles.
    - Points outside the whiskers would be considered outliers, but no outliers are depicted in this plot.

2. **For Bumps = 0:**
    - **Median (50th percentile):** Roughly 650
    - **Interquartile Range (IQR):**
        - **1st Quartile (25th percentile):** Approximately 300
        - **3rd Quartile (75th percentile):** Approximately 1000
    - **Whiskers:**
        - **Minimum Value:** Close to 0
        - **Maximum Value:** Close to 1750

3. **For Bumps = 1:**
    - **Median (50th percentile):** Roughly 900
    - **Interquartile Range (IQR):**
        - **1st Quartile (25th percentile):** Approximately 700
        - **3rd Quartile (75th percentile):** Approximately 1200
    - **Whiskers:**
        - **Minimum Value:** Close to 250
        - **Maximum Value:** Close to 1550

### Insights

1. **Median Comparison:**
    - The median of "X_Maximum" for Bumps = 1 is higher (900) compared to Bumps = 0 (650). This indicates that the central tendency of "X_Maximum" is greater when Bumps = 1.

2. **Spread of Data:**
    - The spread (IQR) of "X_Maximum" is larger for Bumps = 0 (about 700) than for Bumps = 1 (about 500). This suggests that there is more variability in "X_Maximum" when Bumps = 0.
  
3. **Range:**
    - The range of values (difference between maximum and minimum) is slightly wider for Bumps = 0 compared to Bumps = 1. This further indicates more variability within the Bumps = 0 category.

4. **Symmetry and Skewness:**
    - Both distributions seem relatively symmetric, as the median is roughly central within the IQR and the whiskers are of similar length on both sides of the box. There is no indication of significant skewness in either category.

### Conclusions

- **Higher Values with Bumps:** The presence of bumps (Bumps = 1) is associated with higher values of "X_Maximum". This could imply that whatever "X_Maximum" measures, it tends to increase when Bumps is 1.
- **Greater Variability without Bumps:** The absence of bumps (Bumps = 0) is associated with greater variability in "X_Maximum". This might suggest that other factors influence "X_Maximum" more when bumps are not present.
  
Further analysis could investigate the underlying reasons for these differences, explore the potential impact of other variables, and test for statistical significance.
