Based on the provided INFO and PLAN, here are six key questions designed to summarize your findings from the Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis phase and guide you into the Data Cleaning phase:

### Key Questions:

1. **What files were processed, and what outputs were generated during this phase?**
   - **Purpose**: To maintain a clear record of the data files used for analysis (e.g., `train.csv` and `test.csv`) and any summary outputs or visualizations created. This ensures that all steps taken are documented for reference in subsequent phases.

2. **Which features were involved in the analysis, and what changes or observations were noted regarding their data types?**
   - **Purpose**: To identify any modifications in feature types, such as numerical, categorical, or any discrepancies encountered, which may impact the cleaning process. This helps in determining if any data type conversions are necessary for the Data Cleaning phase.

3. **What is the extent of missing values in the dataset, and which features have the highest proportions of missing data?**
   - **Purpose**: To provide a summary of missing data, guiding the cleaning process on which features may require imputation, deletion, or further investigation.

4. **What outliers were detected in the numerical features, and which specific features were most affected?**
   - **Purpose**: To highlight any anomalies in the data that may skew analysis or model performance, informing decisions on how to handle these outliers in the Data Cleaning phase.

5. **What initial insights were gained regarding the distributions of the numerical and categorical features?**
   - **Purpose**: To summarize findings related to feature distributions, which may suggest transformations or specific cleaning actions to ensure better model performance or interpretability.

6. **How do the features correlate with each other, and are there any notable relationships that suggest potential cleaning requirements (e.g., multicollinearity)?**
   - **Purpose**: To identify relationships between features that may complicate modeling, signaling the need for feature selection or dimensionality reduction as part of the cleaning process.

### Summary
These questions are designed to encapsulate the main findings from your Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis and provide clear direction for the Data Cleaning phase, ensuring that you address critical aspects of data quality and preparation.
