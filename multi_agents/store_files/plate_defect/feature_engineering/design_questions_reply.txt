Based on the provided INFO and PLAN, here are six key questions to summarize your findings in the Feature Engineering phase and to guide you into the Model Building, Validation, and Prediction phase:

### Key Questions for Transition to Model Building

1. **What new features were created during this phase, and how do they enhance the dataset's potential for model training?**
   - *Purpose:* This question focuses on understanding the newly derived features, their significance, and how they may contribute to improving model performance by capturing relationships not previously represented.

2. **Which existing features were transformed, and what transformations were applied? Were there any issues with the transformations (e.g., zero values in log transformations)?**
   - *Purpose:* This question aims to summarize the modifications made to existing features, ensuring that any potential issues are noted and addressed before moving on to modeling.

3. **How were categorical variables handled, and what encoding techniques were employed? Are there any considerations to avoid multicollinearity?**
   - *Purpose:* Understanding how categorical features were transformed helps ensure that the model can effectively utilize these variables while avoiding issues like multicollinearity that could negatively impact model performance.

4. **What numerical features were normalized or standardized, and what scaling methods were used? Did the scaling improve feature distributions?**
   - *Purpose:* This question evaluates the effectiveness of the scaling methods applied to numerical features, which is critical for many machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to feature scales.

5. **What feature selection techniques were used, and which features were identified as the most relevant for modeling? Were any domain-relevant features excluded despite low importance?**
   - *Purpose:* Summarizing the feature selection process helps ensure that only the most pertinent features are used in modeling, potentially improving efficiency and performance while retaining important domain knowledge.

6. **What insights or patterns emerged from the feature engineering phase that may influence the choice of modeling techniques and evaluation metrics in the next phase?**
   - *Purpose:* Capturing insights about the dataâ€™s structure and relationships can inform decisions regarding which modeling approaches to pursue and how to evaluate their performance effectively.

These questions will facilitate a thorough review of the feature engineering phase and provide a strong foundation for the upcoming model building, validation, and prediction phase.
