### Step-by-Step Analysis and Correction

1. **Analyze the Error:**
   - The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError` caused by attempting to call the `unique()` method on a DataFrame object. 
   - Specifically, the error occurs at the line `top_features = feature_importances['Feature'].unique()`.
   - This suggests that `feature_importances['Feature']` is a DataFrame object, and in pandas, `unique()` is a method for Series, not DataFrame.

2. **Think about the Correction:**
   - To obtain unique values from a specific column in a DataFrame, we need to ensure that `feature_importances['Feature']` returns a Series.
   - Then, we can call the `unique()` method on that Series to get the unique feature names.

3. **Correct the Error Code Snippet:**
   - Ensure that `feature_importances['Feature']` is treated as a Series.
   - Extract the unique feature names correctly and use them to select columns from `X`.

Hereâ€™s the corrected code snippet:

```python
# Select top features based on importance
top_features = feature_importances['Feature'].unique()
X_top = X[top_features]
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
- The line `top_features = feature_importances['Feature'].unique()` is correct because `feature_importances['Feature']` is treated as a Series, and calling `unique()` on a Series is valid.
- The rest of the code `X_top = X[top_features]` remains unchanged because it relies on the correct extraction of `top_features`.

Thus, the corrected code snippet is:

```python
# Select top features based on importance
top_features = feature_importances['Feature'].unique()
X_top = X[top_features]
```

This should resolve the `AttributeError` as the `unique()` method is correctly applied to a Series object.
