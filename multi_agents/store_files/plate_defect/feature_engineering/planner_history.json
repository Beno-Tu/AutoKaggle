Key features include coordinates (`X_Minimum`, `X_Maximum`, `Y_Minimum`, `Y_Maximum`), area measures (`Pixels_Areas`, `LogOfAreas`), perimeter measures (`X_Perimeter`, `Y_Perimeter`), and luminosity measures (`Sum_of_Luminosity`, `Minimum_of_Luminosity`, `Maximum_of_Luminosity`). There are also indices related to the geometry and placement of defects (`Edges_Index`, `Empty_Index`, `Square_Index`, `Outside_X_Index`, `Edges_X_Index`, `Edges_Y_Index`, `Outside_Global_Index`, `Log_X_Index`, `Log_Y_Index`, `Orientation_Index`, `Luminosity_Index`, `SigmoidOfAreas`). Two categorical features, `TypeOfSteel_A300` and `TypeOfSteel_A400` indicate the type of steel plate.\n\nNotable patterns include:\n- The `id` feature is unique for each data point.\n- Numerical features exhibit various scales and should be normalized for certain machine learning models.\n- Categorical features like `TypeOfSteel_A300` and `TypeOfSteel_A400` are binary indicators.\n- Target variables are multi-label and indicate different types of faults present on the steel plates.\n\n## Target Variable\nThe target variables are multi-label and consist of the following:\n- Pastry\n- Z_Scratch\n- K_Scatch\n- Stains\n- Dirtiness\n- Bumps\n- Other_Faults\n\nThese variables indicate the presence (1) or absence (0) of specific types of faults on the steel plates.\n\n# Submission format (if applicable)\nThe submission file should include the `id` and the predicted values for each of the target variables:\n- id\n- Pastry\n- Z_Scratch\n- K_Scatch\n- Stains\n- Dirtiness\n- Bumps\n- Other_Faults\n\nThe `id` should be unique for each row, and the target variables should be binary (0 or 1) indicating the predicted presence or absence of each fault type.\n\nIn this phase, you have `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv`. Your goals are:\n1. Create new features based on insights from the In-depth EDA.\n2. Transform existing features to improve model performance.\n3. Handle categorical variables (e.g., encoding).\n4. Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.\n5. Select the most relevant features for modeling if necessary.\n6. Other necessary feature engineering steps.\n7. Create `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`.\nOutput: Processed datasets (processed_train.csv and processed_test.csv).\n\n#############\n# NOTE #\n## PLANNING GUIDELINES ##\n1. Limit the plan to a MAXIMUM of FOUR tasks.\n2. Provide clear methods and constraints for each task.\n3. Focus on critical steps specific to the current phase.\n4. Prioritize methods and values mentioned in USER RULES.\n5. Offer detailed plans without writing actual code.\n6. ONLY focus on tasks relevant to this phase, avoiding those belonging to other phases. For example, during the in-depth EDA phase:\n    - you CAN perform detailed univariate analysis on KEY features.\n    - you CAN NOT modify any feature or modify data.\n\n## DATA OUTPUT PREFERENCES ##\n1. Prioritize TEXT format (print) for statistical information.\n2. Print a description before outputting statistics.\n3. Generate images only if text description is inadequate.\n\n## METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS ##\n1. Provide highly detailed methods, especially for data cleaning.\n2. Specify actions for each feature without omissions.\n\n## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ##\n1. Consider runtime and efficiency, particularly for:\n   - Data visualization\n   - Large dataset handling\n   - Complex algorithms\n2. Limit generated images to a MAXIMUM of 10 for EDA.\n3. Focus on critical visualizations with valuable insights.\n\n## OPTIMIZATION EXAMPLE ##\nWhen using seaborn or matplotlib for large datasets:\n- Turn off unnecessary details (e.g., annot=False in heatmaps)\n- Prioritize efficiency in plot generation\n\n#############\n# TASK #\n\nPlease design plan that is clear and specific to each FEATURE for the current development phase: Feature Engineering. \nThe developer will execute tasks based on your plan. \nI will provide you with INFORMATION, RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, and previous reports and plans.\nYou can use the following reasoning pattern to design the plan:\n1. Break down the task into smaller steps.\n2. For each step, ask yourself and answer:\n    - \"What is the objective of this step?\"\n    - \"What are the essential actions to achieve the objective?\"\n    - \"What features are involved in each action?\"\n    - \"Which tool can be used for each action? What are the parameters of the tool?\"\n    - \"What are the expected output of each action? What is the impact of the action on the data?\"\n    - \"What are the constraints of this step?\"\n\n\n#############\n# RESPONSE #\nLet's work this out in a step by step way.\n\n#############\n# START PLANNING #\nBefore you begin, please request the following documents from me, which contain important information that will guide your planning:\n1.

        "content": "To design a detailed and specific plan for the Feature Engineering phase of your data science competition, we'll break down the task into smaller steps. For each step, we will define the objectives, essential actions, involved features, tools, expected outputs, and constraints.\n\n### Documents Request\n\nBefore we start, please provide the following:\n1. **Report and plan from the previous phase**: This will give us insights into the findings from the in-depth exploratory data analysis.\n2. **Available tools in this phase**: Knowing the tools at our disposal will help in designing the steps.\n3. **Sample data for analysis**: A small subset of `cleaned_train.csv` and `cleaned_test.csv` to understand the data structure and content.\n\nNow, let's work on the plan step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Create New Features\n\n**Objective**: Generate new features based on insights from the in-depth EDA to capture more information that could improve model performance.\n\n**Actions**:\n1. **Ratio Features**:\n   - Create new features by calculating ratios of existing numerical features. For example:\n     - `X_Range` = `X_Maximum` - `X_Minimum`\n     - `Y_Range` = `Y_Maximum` - `Y_Minimum`\n     - `X_Y_Ratio` = `X_Range` / (`Y_Range` + 1e-5) (to avoid division by zero)\n   - **Tools**: Pandas\n   - **Expected Output**: New columns in the dataset representing ratio features.\n\n2. **Interaction Features**:\n   - Create interaction terms between key features that might have a combined effect. For example:\n     - `Luminosity_Area_Product` = `Sum_of_Luminosity` * `Pixels_Areas`\n   - **Tools**: Pandas\n   - **Expected Output**: New columns in the dataset representing interaction features.\n\n3. **Log Transformation**:\n   - Apply log transformation to skewed numerical features to reduce skewness. For example:\n     - `Log_X_Perimeter` = log(`X_Perimeter` + 1) (to handle zero values)\n   - **Tools**: NumPy\n   - **Expected Output**: New columns in the dataset representing log-transformed features.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- Ensure that the new features are interpretable and relevant to the problem.\n- Avoid creating too many features that could lead to overfitting.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Transform Existing Features\n\n**Objective**: Modify existing features to improve model performance by making them more suitable for machine learning algorithms.\n\n**Actions**:\n1. **Normalization/Standardization**:\n   - Normalize or standardize numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale. For example:\n     - Normalize using Min-Max scaling: `(feature - min) / (max - min)`\n     - Standardize using Z-score: `(feature - mean) / std`\n   - **Tools**: Scikit-learn (`MinMaxScaler`, `StandardScaler`)\n   - **Expected Output**: Scaled numerical features.\n\n2. **Binning**:\n   - Bin continuous features into categorical bins to capture non-linear relationships. For example:\n     - Bin `Sum_of_Luminosity` into quartiles.\n   - **Tools**: Pandas (`pd.cut`)\n   - **Expected Output**: New categorical features representing bins.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- Choose the appropriate scaling technique based on the distribution of each feature.\n- Avoid over-binning, which may lead to loss of information.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Handle Categorical Variables\n\n**Objective**: Convert categorical variables into a format suitable for machine learning models.\n\n**Actions**:\n1. **One-Hot Encoding**:\n   - Apply one-hot encoding to binary categorical features (`TypeOfSteel_A300`, `TypeOfSteel_A400`) and multi-label target variables.\n   - **Tools**: Pandas (`pd.get_dummies`)\n   - **Expected Output**: New columns representing one-hot encoded categorical features.\n\n2. **Label Encoding** (if applicable):\n   - Convert categorical features with more than two categories into numerical format using label encoding.\n   - **Tools**: Scikit-learn (`LabelEncoder`)\n   - **Expected Output**: Numerical columns representing encoded categorical features.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- Ensure that the encoded features do not introduce multicollinearity.\n- Handle potential issues with unseen categories in the test set.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Feature Selection\n\n**Objective**: Identify and retain the most relevant features for modeling to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance.\n\n**Actions**:\n1. **Correlation Analysis**:\n   - Analyze the correlation between features and target variables to identify highly correlated features.\n   - **Tools**: Pandas, Seaborn (for visualization)\n   - **Expected Output**: A correlation matrix and a list of highly correlated features.\n\n2. **Feature Importance**:\n   - Use feature importance methods (e.g., from tree-based models) to identify and select important features.\n   - **Tools**: Scikit-learn (e.g., RandomForest, XGBoost)\n   - **Expected Output**: A ranked list of features based on their importance.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- Avoid removing features that are domain-relevant even if they show low importance.\n- Ensure that the selected features collectively provide comprehensive information to the model.\n\n---\n\n### Expected Output\n\nBy the end of these tasks, you should have:\n- New, transformed, and selected features in `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv`.\n- A clear understanding of how each feature impacts the target variables.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide the requested documents so we can refine the plan further based on previous insights and available tools."

Are there any derived categorical features that could be beneficial?\n### Answer 5\n- **Patterns Observed:**\n  - The `TypeOfSteel_A300` and `TypeOfSteel_A400` features show distinct patterns when analyzed against target variables \u2014 for example, certain types of steel correlate with fewer defects.\n  \n- **Derived Features:**\n  - Consider creating a combined categorical feature that incorporates both steel types for modeling purposes, which may simplify the analysis and enhance predictive power.\n\n### Question 6\nBased on the findings from the exploratory data analysis, what specific feature engineering actions are recommended, and how should they be prioritized?\n### Answer 6\n- **Recommended Actions:**\n  1. Create polynomial and interaction features for numerical features with significant correlations.\n  2. Normalize or log-transform skewed numerical features to enhance model training.\n  3. Develop combined categorical features from `TypeOfSteel_A300` and `TypeOfSteel_A400`.\n  \n- **Prioritization:**\n  - Start with transformations that directly address the skewness in numerical features, followed by the creation of interaction and polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships.\n  - Lastly, focus on categorical feature derivations to optimize the modeling process.\n\n#############\n# TARGET VARIABLE #\n['Pastry', 'Z_Scratch', 'K_Scatch', 'Stains', 'Dirtiness', 'Bumps', 'Other_Faults']\n#############\n# CLEANED TRAIN DATA WITH FEATURES #\nid,X_Minimum,X_Maximum,Y_Minimum,Y_Maximum,Pixels_Areas,X_Perimeter,Y_Perimeter,Sum_of_Luminosity,Minimum_of_Luminosity,Maximum_of_Luminosity,Length_of_Conveyer,TypeOfSteel_A300,TypeOfSteel_A400,Steel_Plate_Thickness,Edges_Index,Empty_Index,Square_Index,Outside_X_Index,Edges_X_Index,Edges_Y_Index,Outside_Global_Index,LogOfAreas,Log_X_Index,Log_Y_Index,Orientation_Index,Luminosity_Index,SigmoidOfAreas,Pastry,Z_Scratch,K_Scatch,Stains,Dirtiness,Bumps,Other_Faults\n\n#############\n# CLEANED TEST DATA WITH FEATURES #\nid,X_Minimum,X_Maximum,Y_Minimum,Y_Maximum,Pixels_Areas,X_Perimeter,Y_Perimeter,Sum_of_Luminosity,Minimum_of_Luminosity,Maximum_of_Luminosity,Length_of_Conveyer,TypeOfSteel_A300,TypeOfSteel_A400,Steel_Plate_Thickness,Edges_Index,Empty_Index,Square_Index,Outside_X_Index,Edges_X_Index,Edges_Y_Index,Outside_Global_Index,LogOfAreas,Log_X_Index,Log_Y_Index,Orientation_Index,Luminosity_Index,SigmoidOfAreas\n# AVAILABLE TOOLS #\nThere is no pre-defined tools in this phase.
