Key features include coordinates (`X_Minimum`, `X_Maximum`, `Y_Minimum`, `Y_Maximum`), area measures (`Pixels_Areas`, `LogOfAreas`), perimeter measures (`X_Perimeter`, `Y_Perimeter`), and luminosity measures (`Sum_of_Luminosity`, `Minimum_of_Luminosity`, `Maximum_of_Luminosity`).

We have the necessary information and the cleaned data ready. Let's proceed with the feature engineering phase as planned. I'll implement each task step-by-step and provide the code with explanations.\n\n### TASK 1: Create New Features\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe'll create new features based on the relationships between existing numerical features. These new features might capture additional information that can improve model performance.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load cleaned data\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/plate_defect/cleaned_train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/plate_defect/cleaned_test.csv')\n\ndef create_new_features(df):\n    df = df.copy()\n    \n    # Create new features\n    df['X_Range'] = df['X_Maximum'] - df['X_Minimum']\n    df['Y_Range'] = df['Y_Maximum'] - df['Y_Minimum']\n    df['X_Y_Ratio'] = df['X_Range'] / (df['Y_Range'] + 1e-5)  # Avoid division by zero\n    df['Luminosity_Area_Product'] = df['Sum_of_Luminosity'] * df['Pixels_Areas']\n    df['Perimeter_Area_Ratio'] = (df['X_Perimeter'] + df['Y_Perimeter']) / (df['Pixels_Areas'] + 1e-5)  # Avoid division by zero\n    \n    # Polynomial features\n    df['X_Minimum^2'] = df['X_Minimum'] ** 2\n    df['X_Maximum^2'] = df['X_Maximum'] ** 2\n    df['Y_Minimum^2'] = df['Y_Minimum'] ** 2\n    df['Y_Maximum^2'] = df['Y_Maximum'] ** 2\n    df['X_Minimum*X_Maximum'] = df['X_Minimum'] * df['X_Maximum']\n    df['Y_Minimum*Y_Maximum'] = df['Y_Minimum'] * df['Y_Maximum']\n    \n    return df\n\n# Apply the feature creation function\ntrain_df = create_new_features(train_df)\ntest_df = create_new_features(test_df)\n\n# Save the updated dataframes\ntrain_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/plate_defect/processed_train.csv', index=False)\ntest_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/plate_defect/processed_test.csv', index=False)\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code loads the cleaned training and test datasets, creates new features based on the relationships between existing numerical features, and saves the updated datasets.\n\n### TASK 2: Transform Existing Features\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will use scaling and log transformations to normalize the distribution of numerical features. This helps in improving the performance of machine learning models.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform_features(df):\n    df = df.copy()\n    \n    # List of features to scale\n    features_to_scale = ['Pixels_Areas', 'Sum_of_Luminosity', 'X_Perimeter', 'Y_Perimeter']\n    \n    # Scale features using MinMaxScaler\n    scaler = MinMaxScaler()\n    df[features_to_scale] = scaler.fit_transform(df[features_to_scale])\n    \n    # Log transformation\n    df['Log_Sum_of_Luminosity'] = np.log1p(df['Sum_of_Luminosity'])  # log1p to handle zero values\n    df['Log_Pixels_Areas'] = np.log1p(df['Pixels_Areas'])\n    \n    return df\n\n# Apply the transformation function\ntrain_df = transform_features(train_df)\ntest_df = transform_features(test_df)\n\n# Save the updated dataframes\ntrain_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/plate_defect/processed_train.csv', index=False)\ntest_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/plate_defect/processed_test.csv', index=False)\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code scales the specified numerical features using `MinMaxScaler` and applies log transformation to handle skewed distributions.\n\n### TASK 3: Handle Categorical Variables\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will encode the binary categorical variables using one-hot encoding. This is essential for the model to interpret categorical data.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\ndef encode_categorical(df):\n    df = df.copy()\n\n    # One-hot encoding for 'TypeOfSteel_A300' and 'TypeOfSteel_A400'\n    df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['TypeOfSteel_A300', 'TypeOfSteel_A400'], drop_first=True)\n    \n    return df\n\n# Apply the encoding function\ntrain_df = encode_categorical(train_df)\ntest_df = encode_categorical(test_df)\n\n# Save the updated dataframes\ntrain_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/plate_defect/processed_train.csv', index=False)\ntest_df.to_csv('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/plate_defect/processed_test.csv', index=False)\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code applies one-hot encoding to the categorical variables `TypeOfSteel_A300` and `TypeOfSteel_A400`, ensuring consistency across training and test datasets.\n\n### TASK 4: Feature Selection\n\n#### Thought Process:\nWe will use correlation analysis and feature importance techniques to select the most relevant features for modeling. This helps in reducing the dimensionality and focusing on impactful features.\n\n#### Code:\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\ndef plot_correlation_matrix(df):\n    # Calculate correlation matrix\n    corr = df.corr()\n    \n    # Plot heatmap\n    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))\n    sns.heatmap(corr, annot=False, cmap='coolwarm')\n    plt.title(\"Correlation Matrix\")\n    plt.savefig('/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/plate_defect/feature_engineering/images/correlation_matrix.png')\n    plt.close()\n\n# Plot correlation matrix for training data\nplot_correlation_matrix(train_df)\n\n# Feature importance using RandomForestClassifier\ndef feature_importance(df, target_columns):\n    X = df.drop(columns=target_columns)\n    y = df[target_columns]\n    \n    # Train RandomForestClassifier for each target variable\n    for target in target_columns:\n        clf = RandomForestClassifier()\n        clf.fit(X, y[target])\n        importances = clf.feature_importances_\n        feature_importance_df = pd.DataFrame({'Feature': X.columns, 'Importance': importances}).sort_values(by='Importance', ascending=False)\n        print(f\"Feature importance for {target}:\")\n        print(feature_importance_df.head(10))\n\n# List of target columns\ntarget_columns = ['Pastry', 'Z_Scratch', 'K_Scatch', 'Stains', 'Dirtiness', 'Bumps', 'Other_Faults']\n\n# Calculate feature importance\nfeature_importance(train_df, target_columns)\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\nThis code first plots the correlation matrix to visualize relationships between features. Then, it calculates feature importance using `RandomForestClassifier` for each target variable and prints the top 10 important features.\n\nBy combining these tasks, we ensure that the data is well-prepared for the model building phase. The processed datasets are saved for further use. Each step is documented and follows the constraints provided.\n</EXECUTION RESULT>\n\n"
