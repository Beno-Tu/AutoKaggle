In the context of the feature engineering phase, the most relevant image would typically provide insights into the relationships between different features in the dataset, which can guide the selection and creation of new features.

Given that there is only one image provided, I will select that image:

```json
{
    "images": [
        "correlation_matrix.png"
    ]
}
```
