### Task 1: Data Preparation for Model Training
**Objective:** Prepare the training data by separating target variables and removing irrelevant columns.
**Essential Actions:**
1. **Separate Target Variable (y):**
   - Extract the target columns: `Pastry`, `Z_Scratch`, `K_Scatch`, `Stains`, `Dirtiness`, `Bumps`, `Other_Faults` from the training set into `y_train`.

2. **Remove Irrelevant Columns:**
   - Drop the target columns and `id` column from the training data (`processed_train.csv`).

**Features Involved:** All columns in `processed_train.csv`
**Tool:** Pandas
**Expected Output:** Cleaned training data (`X_train`) and target variables (`y_train`).
**Constraints:** Ensure no data leakage by not using target columns in the features.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Load Data:**
   - Load `processed_train.csv` into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Separate Targets:**
   - Create `y_train` by extracting the columns `['Pastry', 'Z_Scratch', 'K_Scatch', 'Stains', 'Dirtiness', 'Bumps', 'Other_Faults']`.

3. **Remove Irrelevant Columns:**
   - Drop the `id` and target columns from the DataFrame to create `X_train`.

### Task 2: Model Selection and Training
**Objective:** Train up to three different models on the training data and select the best performing one.
**Essential Actions:**
1. **Model Selection:**
   - Determine three model types suitable for the task. For example:
     1. Random Forest
     2. Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
     3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

2. **Model Training:**
   - Use the `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` tool to train each model using cross-validation to evaluate performance.
   - Use AUC as the evaluation metric for each defect category and average the results.

**Features Involved:** All features in `X_train`
**Tool:** `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` from available tools
**Expected Output:** Trained models and their cross-validation performance metrics.
**Constraints:** Limit to three models due to computational resource limitations.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Set Parameters:**
   - Define the models to be used: `["random forest", "XGBoost", "SVM"]`.

2. **Train Models:**
   - Use the `train_and_validation_and_select_the_best_model` tool with `X_train`, `y_train`, and the selected models to train and validate.
   - Monitor the AUC scores for each model.

### Task 3: Model Validation and Selection
**Objective:** Validate the models and select the best one based on performance.
**Essential Actions:**
1. **Evaluate Models:**
   - Compare the cross-validation AUC scores of the three models.
   - Select the model with the highest average AUC score across all defect categories.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning (if needed):**
   - If two or more models have very close performance, perform hyperparameter tuning on the best-performing model(s) using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to further optimize performance.

**Features Involved:** All features in `X_train` and `y_train`
**Tool:** Scikit-learn (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)
**Expected Output:** Best model with optimized hyperparameters.
**Constraints:** Focus on AUC scores for model comparison and selection.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Compare AUC Scores:**
   - Evaluate the cross-validation results and compare the average AUC scores.

2. **Select Best Model:**
   - Choose the model with the highest average AUC score.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - If required, perform hyperparameter tuning on the selected model to find the best parameters.

### Task 4: Prediction on Test Set
**Objective:** Use the selected model to make predictions on the test set.
**Essential Actions:**
1. **Prepare Test Data:**
   - Remove the `id` column from the test set (`processed_test.csv`).
   - Ensure the test data has the same columns as the training data (excluding target columns).

2. **Make Predictions:**
   - Use the selected model to predict probabilities for each defect category on the test set.

3. **Format Submission:**
   - Create a submission DataFrame with `id` and predicted probabilities for each defect category.
   - Ensure the format matches the required submission format.

**Features Involved:** All features in `processed_test.csv`
**Tool:** Scikit-learn (predict_proba method)
**Expected Output:** Submission file with predicted probabilities.
**Constraints:** Ensure consistency between training and test data preprocessing.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Load Test Data:**
   - Load `processed_test.csv` into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Prepare Test Data:**
   - Drop the `id` column from the DataFrame to create `X_test`.

3. **Predict Probabilities:**
   - Use the trained model's `predict_proba` method to generate probabilities for each defect category.

4. **Create Submission File:**
   - Combine the `id` column with the predicted probabilities to create a submission DataFrame.
   - Save the submission DataFrame in the required format.

### Final Notes:
- Ensure that each step is executed carefully to avoid data leakage.
- Focus on managing computational resources efficiently, especially during model training and validation.
- Pay close attention to the AUC scores as they are the evaluation metric for this competition.
