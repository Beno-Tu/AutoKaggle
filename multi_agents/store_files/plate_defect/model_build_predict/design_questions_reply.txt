Here are six key questions designed to summarize the findings from the Model Building, Validation, and Prediction phase and provide guidance for future actions:

1. **What models were trained during this phase, and what were their respective AUC scores on the validation set?**
   - *Purpose:* This question summarizes the performance of the models used during training and helps identify which model performed best, aiding in decision-making for future model deployments or improvements.

2. **What preprocessing steps were applied to the training and test datasets, and were there any inconsistencies encountered?**
   - *Purpose:* Understanding the preprocessing steps taken ensures that all data transformations are documented. This is crucial for maintaining consistency in future analyses or if the model needs to be retrained.

3. **Which features had the most significant impact on model performance, and how did you determine their importance?**
   - *Purpose:* Identifying key features that influence model predictions can guide future feature engineering efforts and help in refining the model.

4. **Were there any challenges faced during model training or validation, and how were they addressed?**
   - *Purpose:* Documenting challenges and their solutions can provide insights for future projects, helping to prevent similar issues from arising.

5. **What are the predicted probabilities for each defect category in the test set, and how do they compare to the expected distributions?**
   - *Purpose:* Evaluating the predicted probabilities against expected distributions can highlight potential issues with the model predictions and inform future adjustments or calibrations.

6. **What recommendations can be made for potential next steps in model improvement or for preparing for deployment based on the current findings?**
   - *Purpose:* This question encourages strategic thinking about the next steps, whether it involves further model tuning, additional data collection, or preparing for deployment, ensuring that the project continues to progress effectively.

These questions are crafted to provide a comprehensive review of the current phase while guiding future work based on the insights gained.
