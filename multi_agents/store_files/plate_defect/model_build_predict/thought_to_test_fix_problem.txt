Let's go through the steps to identify and correct the issue with the code snippet that is causing the test case to fail.

### Step 1: Analyze the Issue

The error message indicates that the `submission.csv` file has different column names or column order compared to `sample_submission.csv`. Specifically, the columns in `submission.csv` are named with class labels (e.g., `Stains_class_1`, `Dirtiness_class_1`), while `sample_submission.csv` expects columns without class labels (e.g., `Stains`, `Dirtiness`).

### Step 2: Think of a Solution

To align `submission.csv` with `sample_submission.csv`, we need to:
1. Aggregate the predicted probabilities for each defect category into a single probability score for each category.
2. Ensure the columns in `submission.csv` match the expected columns in `sample_submission.csv`.

### Step 3: Correct the Code Snippet

We need to modify the code to aggregate the probabilities and rename the columns accordingly. Here's the corrected code snippet:

```python
# Predict probabilities for each defect category using the best model
predictions = multi_target_model.predict_proba(X_test)

# Aggregate the predictions into a DataFrame with columns for each class probability
predictions_dict = {}
for i, target in enumerate(target_columns):
    # Assuming binary classification (class 0 and class 1)
    class_1_probabilities = predictions[i][:, 1]
    predictions_dict[target] = class_1_probabilities

# Create the DataFrame from the dictionary
predictions_df = pd.DataFrame(predictions_dict)

# Ensure the columns are in the correct order as in sample_submission.csv
expected_columns = ['id'] + target_columns

# Create a submission DataFrame
submission_df = pd.DataFrame(test_df['id'], columns=['id'])
submission_df = pd.concat([submission_df, predictions_df], axis=1)
submission_df = submission_df[expected_columns]

# Save the submission DataFrame
submission_file = '/mnt/d/PythonProjects/AutoKaggleMaster/multi_agents/competition/plate_defect/submission.csv'
submission_df.to_csv(submission_file, index=False)
```

### Explanation

1. **Prediction and Aggregation**:
   - We predict probabilities using the `multi_target_model.predict_proba(X_test)` method.
   - For each target column, we extract the probabilities for class 1 (assuming binary classification), which represents the defect being present.
   - We create a dictionary `predictions_dict` to store these probabilities with the target column names as keys.

2. **DataFrame Creation and Ordering**:
   - We convert `predictions_dict` into a DataFrame `predictions_df`.
   - We create `submission_df` by combining the `id` column from `test_df` with `predictions_df`.
   - We ensure the columns in `submission_df` are in the same order as `expected_columns`, which includes `id` followed by the target columns.

3. **Saving the Submission File**:
   - Finally, we save `submission_df` to the specified file path.

With these corrections, the `submission.csv` file should have the correct column names and order, matching `sample_submission.csv`.
